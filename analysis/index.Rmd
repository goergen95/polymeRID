## Introduction  


Here I present the results of my work for a master's seminar at the 
University of Marburg concerned with microplastic in the environment.

Microplastic particles polluting the environment has been in the public focus
for some time now. The scientific efforts of analyzing the occurrences
of particles in the environment and their effects on ecosystems and human health
is manifold, yet there is a lack of consensus on methods for sampling, sample handling,
analysis and identification, especially for samples from aquatic ecosystems.
Some of the most urgent research questions concerned with microplastic
are the effects on biological lifeforms [@Zhang2019], their movement through and
distribution in marine environments [@Auta2017] as well as in freshwater ecosystems [@Li2018b].

Different research questions demand different methodologies for sampling,
sample handling and laboratory analysis. However, the link between different
research domains is that any analysis of microplastic in the environment needs a 
robust identification method to enable scientists to bring forward 
meaningful recommendations to the public and decision makers.

A broad spectrum of different polymer identification strategies evidently exists
[@Loder2015;@Rocha-Santos2015a;@Shim2017], ranging from traditional microscopy 
to spectroscopy as well as destructive methods of thermal analysis. A distinction
has to be made towards the extent of automatization in the identification
process. Recently, different approaches to automate the task of polymer classification,
either by individual particles or for a whole collection of samples simultaneously
have been reported to the scientific community [@Masoumi2012;@Primpke2017;@Lorenzo-Navarro2018;@Zhang2018;@Primpke2019].

This project sets out to contribute to the ease of the cumbersome process of 
classifying individual particles based on their spectral reflectance by hand.
The idea is that up-to-date machine learning models applied to the 
high-dimensional spectral data of particles found in environmental samples can 
minimize the need for human intervention in the classification process and 
thus significantly speed up the process of classification.
Other studies have reported substantial accuracies by applying different kinds
of machine learning algorithms such as hierarchical clustering [@Primpke2017], 
support-vector-machines [@bianco2019], random forest [@Hufnagl2019], as well as
convolutional neural networks [@Liu2017] to classify the spectra of microplastic
and other materials found in environmental samples.

This project was grouped into different working steps, which were designed 
to allow to reproduce the workflows to the greatest extent possible
as well as to allow alterations of the code and extensions to the database. 
These working steps are:    

* [**Preparation**](preparation.html): At first the establishment of a comprehensive database of reference spectra was mandatory to allow the application of machine-learning models. We used an OpenSource database published by @Primpke2018. For potential future extensions, we created a workflow of spectral resampling and baseline correction for reference polymers and other particles to ensure the consistency of the database.

* [**Exploration**](exploration.html): Different types of pre-processing techniques were assessed by a cross-validation approach in which different representations of data were presented to a selection of machine-learning models. Their capability to correctly classify the database was captured. Additionally, increasing levels of noise were added to the data so that the models and pre-processing techniques which most robustly classify polymer spectra could be identified. 

* [**Calibration**](calibration.html): After the exploration stage, the best performing models were chosen to create a decision fusion model. A workflow was created to calibrate these models to a potentially changing database when needed. This step is crucial so that the work presented here can be used in the future, i.e. in the case of a 
extension of the reference database or a change in the spectral resolution.  

* [**Classification**](classification.html): At the final stage of the project, a workflow was created to classify real environmental samples in a user-friendly way to ease the classification process. Here, some accuracy values of the classification are extracted and comprehensively handed to the user, as well as some plots for a visual confirmation of the classification results. This way, it is ensured that the results are easily accessible and the possibility for a human agent to assess the quality of the classification is implemented.
