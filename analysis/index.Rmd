## Introduction  


Here I present the results of my work for a master's seminar at the 
University of Marburg concerned with microplastic in the environment.

Micro-plastic particles polluting the environment have been in the public focus
for some time now. The scientific efforts of analyzing the occurrences
of particles in the environment and their effects on ecosystems and human health
is manifold, yet there is a lack of consensus on methods for sampling, sample handling,
analysis and identification, especially for samples from aquatic ecosystems.
Some of the most urgent research questions concerned with micro-plastic in the environment
are the analysis of effects on biological lifeforms [@Zhang2019], their movement and
distribution in the marine environment [@Auta2017] as well as in freshwater systems [@Li2018b].

Different research questions demand for different methodologies for sampling,
sample handling and laboratory analysis. However, the link between these 
research fields is that any analysis of microplastics in the environment needs a 
robust identification method to enable scientist to draw the right conclusions 
and to bring forward recommendations to the public and decision makers to act upon
their research findings.

Evidently, there also exist a broad spectrum of different polymer identification
strategies [@Loder2015;@Rocha-Santos2015a;@Shim2017], ranging from traditional microscopy 
to spectroscopy as well as destructive methods of thermal analysis. A distinction
has to be made towards the extent of automatisation in the identification
process. Recently, different approaches to automate the task of polymer classification,
either by for individual particles or for a whole collection of samples, e.g. on 
a focal plane, have been reported to the scientific community [@Masoumi2012;@Primpke2017;@Lorenzo-Navarro2018;@Zhang2018;@Primpke2019]

This project sets out to contribute to the ease of the cumbersome process of 
classifying individual particles based on their spectral reflectance by hand.
The idea is that up-to-date machine learning models applied to the 
high-dimensional spectral data of particles found in environmental samples can 
minimize the need for human intervention in the classification process and 
thus significantly speed up the process of classification of particles.
Other studies have reported substantial accuracies by applying different kinds
of machine learning algorithms such as hierarchical clustering [@Primpke2017], 
support-vector-machines [@bianco2019], random forest [@Hufnagl2019], as well as
convolutional neural networks [@Liu2017] to classify the spectra of microplastics 
and other materials found in environmental samples.

This project was grouped into different working steps, which were designed 
to allow the reproducibility of the workflows to the greatest extent possible
as well as to allow alterations of the code and extensions to the data base. 
These working steps are:    

* [**Preparation**](preparation.html): At first the establishment of a comprehensive database of reference spectra was mandatory to allow the application of machine learning models. We used a OpenSource data base published by @Primpke2018. For potential extensions of the data base, we created a workflow of spectral resampling and baseline correction of reference polymers and other particles in accordance with the original data base.

* [**Exploration**](exploration.html): Different types of preprocessing techniques were assessed by a cross-validation approach in which all different levels of the data were presented to a selection of machine learning models and their capability to correctly classify the data set was captured. Additionally, different levels of noise were added to the data so that the models and preprocessing types which most robustly classify polymer spectra could be identified. 

* [**Calibration**](calibration.html): After the exploration stage, the best performing models were chosen to create a decision fusion model. A workflow was created to calibrate these models to a potentially changing data base when needed. That step is crucial, so that the work presented here can be used in the future, e.g. when the reference data base will be extended or in the case of a change in the spectral resolution of the samples.  

* [**Classification**](classification.html): At this last stage of the project, a workflow was created to classify real environmental samples in a user-friendly way to ease the classification process. Here, some accuracy values of the classification are extracted and comprehensively handed to the user, as well as some plots for a visual confirmation of the classification results. This way, it is ensured that the results are easily accessible and the possibility for a human agent to assess the quality of
the classification is implemented.
