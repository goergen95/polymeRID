abstract = {Multi-platform and multi-sensor observations are employed to investigate the impact of mineral dust on cloud microphysical and precipitation processes in mesoscale convective systems. For a given convective strength, small hydrometeors were more prevalent in the stratiform rain regions with dust than in those regions that were dust free. Evidence of abundant cloud ice particles in the dust sector, particularly at altitudes where heterogeneous nucleation of mineral dust prevails, further supports the observed changes of precipitation. The consequences of the microphysical effects of the dust aerosols were to shift the precipitation size spectrum from heavy precipitation to light precipitation and ultimately suppressing precipitation.},

abstract = {The human-induced desiccation of the Aral Sea has generated large amounts of salt dust and has been posing a great threat to local ecological environment and human health. Monitoring its land cover changes is essential to obtaining information about the desertification process and dynamics of potential salt/sand dust source. To this end, long-term Landsat imagery was applied for the land use/cover change analysis based on support vector machine approach. The land cover distribution of the study area for 1977, 1987, 1996, 2006 and 2015 was mapped. In addition, the Markov–cellular automata integrated approach was used to predict the land cover change in 2015 and project changes in 2025 by extrapolating current trends. The classification results revealed that water surface of the Aral Sea shrunk by more than 66{\%}, leading to the dramatic expanding of the salt soil and bare area. Change detection analysis indicated a serious land degradation trend as well as a major land cover evolution mode in the Aral Kum that could predict shifts in dust composition. The Markov–cellular automata technique was successful in predicting land cover distribution in 2015, and the projected land cover for 2025 revealed more desertification of the landscape with potential expansion in the salt soils and bare area. It is worth noting that the vegetation cover of the region represented an obvious increase in recent years that may be a good signal of ecological recovery.},

abstract = {The effect of desert dust on cloud properties and precipitation has so far been studied solely by using theoretical models, which predict that rainfall would be enhanced. Here we present observations showing the contrary; the effect of dust on cloud properties is to inhibit precipitation. Using satellite and aircraft observations we show that clouds forming within desert dust contain small droplets and produce little precipitation by drop coalescence. Measurement of the size distribution and the chemical analysis of individual Saharan dust particles collected in such a dust storm suggest a possible mechanism for the diminished rainfall. The detrimental impact of dust on rainfall is smaller than that caused by smoke from biomass burning or anthropogenic air pollution, but the large abundance of desert dust in the atmosphere renders it important. The reduction of precipitation from clouds affected by desert dust can cause drier soil, which in turn raises more dust, thus providing a possible feedback loop to further decrease precipitation. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes of land use exposing the topsoil can initiate such a desertification feedback process.},

abstract = {Clouds are important elements in climatic processes and interactions between aerosols and clouds are therefore a hot topic for scientific research. Aerosols show both spatial and temporal variations, which can lead to variations in the microphysics of clouds. In this research, we have examined the spatial and temporal variations in aerosol particles over Pakistan and the impact of these variations on various optical properties of clouds, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra satellite. We used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for trajectory analysis to reveal the origins of air masses, with the aim of understanding these spatial and temporal variabilities in aerosol concentrations. We also documented seasonal variations in patterns of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Pakistan, for which the highest values occur during the monsoon season (June-August). We then analyzed the relationships between AOD and four other cloud parameters, namely water vapour (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud top pressure (CTP). Regional correlation maps and time series plots for aerosol (AOD) and cloud parameters were produced to provide a better understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction. The analyses showed strong positive correlations between AOD and WV for all of the eight cities investigated. The correlation between AOD and CF was positive for those cities where the air masses were predominantly humid, but negative for those cities where the air masses were relatively dry and carried a low aerosol abundance. These correlations were clearly dependent on the meteorological conditions for all of the eight cities investigated. Because of the observed AOD-CF relationship, the co-variation of AOD with CTP and CTT may be attributable to large-scale meteorological variations: AOD showed a positive correlation with CTP and CTT in northern regions of Pakistan and a negative correlation in southern regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The same prescribed anthropogenic aerosol forcing was implemented into three climate models. The atmosphere components of these participating climate models were the GAMIL, ECHAM, and CAM models. Ensemble simulations were carried out to obtain a reliable estimate of anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF). The ensemble mean ERFs from these three participating models with this aerosol forcing were {\&}minus;0.27, {\&}minus;0.63, and {\&}minus;0.54 W∙m{\&}minus;2. The model diversity in ERF is clearly reduced as compared with those based on the models{\&}rsquo; own default approaches ({\&}minus;1.98, {\&}minus;0.21, and {\&}minus;2.22 W∙m{\&}minus;2). This is consistent with the design of this aerosol forcing. The modeled ERF can be decomposed into two basic components, i.e., the instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) from aerosol{\&}ndash;radiation interactions (RFari) and the aerosol-induced changes in cloud forcing (△Fcloud*). For the three participating models, the model diversity in RFari ({\&}minus;0.21, {\&}minus;0.33, and {\&}minus;0.29 W∙m{\&}minus;2) could be constrained by reducing the differences in natural aerosol radiative forcings. However, it was difficult to figure out the reason for the model diversity in △Fcloud* ({\&}minus;0.05, {\&}minus;0.28, and {\&}minus;0.24 W∙m{\&}minus;2), which was the dominant source of the model diversity in ERF. The variability of modeled ERF was also studied. Ensemble simulations showed that the modeled RFs were very stable. The rapid adjustments (ERF {\&}minus; RF) had an important role to play in the quantification of the perturbation of ERF. Fortunately, the contribution from the rapid adjustments to the mean ERF was very small. This study also showed that we should pay attention to the difference between the aerosol climate effects we want and the aerosol climate effects we calculate.},

abstract = {The desiccation of the Aral Sea ranks among the largest man-made ecological catastrophes and has become a global symbol for the overexploitation of limited resources and the environmental and socio-economic consequences caused thereby. Formerly the fourth largest inland lake, large parts of the Aral Sea have been transformed into a salty desert – the Aralkum. The exposed lake bed sediments are subject to wind erosion, resulting in white sand and dust storms which have been tracked over several hundred kilometres using remote sensing images. Dust deposition data, on the other hand, requires excessive field work over prolonged periods of time and thus is scarce. But this kind of ground-based monitoring provides valuable insights into the physical and chemical composition of the transported material. The dust transported from the Aralkum contains, among other things, salts, heavy metals and agrochemicals deposited in the Aral Sea over decades. It can contribute to soil salinization, damage crops and technical infrastructure and impair the human health in the region surrounding the Aralkum, making the analysis of the aeolian dust deposition highly relevant. In the study presented here passive dust deposition data from 23 meteorological stations in the Turan lowland have been collected between 2003 and 2012 and analyzed for their grain size, mineralogical, and chemical characterization in order to identify the influence the newly formed Aralkum has on the Central Asian dust dynamic.},

abstract = {East Asia is a major dust source in the world. Mineral dusts in the atmosphere and their interactions with clouds and precipitation have great impacts on regional climate in Asia, where there are large arid and semiarid regions. In this review paper, we summarize the typical transport paths of East Asian dust, which affect regional and global climates, and discuss numerous effects of dust aerosols on clouds and precipitation primarily over East Asian arid and semiarid regions. We hope to provide a benchmark of our present understanding of these issues. Compared with the aerosols of Saharan dust, those of East Asian dust are more absorptive of solar radiation, and its direct radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere is nearly positive or nil. It means that aerosols of East Asian dust can influence the cloud properties not only by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei (via first indirect effect, second indirect effect, and invigoration effect) but also through changing the relative humidity and stability of the atmosphere (via semidirect effect). Converting visible light to thermal energy, dust aerosols can burn clouds to produce a warming effect on climate, which is opposite to the first and second indirect effects of aerosols. The net dust aerosol radiative effects are still highly unclear. In addition, dust can inhibit or enhance precipitation under certain conditions, thus impacting the hydrological cycle. Over Asian arid and semiarid regions, the positive feedback loop in the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction may aggravate drought in its inner land.},

All sensors agree very well on the interannual variability of DOD. The seasonal analysis of DOD and dust occurrences identified the largest dust loading and the most frequent dust occurrence in the spring and summer, respectively. No significant trend was found during the research period in terms of both DOD and the dust occurrence. Further analysis of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) aerosol products on a case-by-case basis in most dust months of 2007 suggested that the vertical structure is varying in terms of the extension and the dust loading from one event to another, although dust particles of most episodes have similar physical characteristics (particle shape and size). Our analysis on the vertical structure of dust plumes, the layer-integrated color ratio and depolarization ratio indicates a varied climate effect (e.g., the direct radiative impact) by mineral dust, dependent on the event being observed in Central Asia.},

The mean ice water path (IWP) and liquid water path (LWP) of dusty clouds are less than their dust-free counterparts by 23.7{\%} and 49.8{\%}, respectively. The long-term statistical : relationship derived from ISCCP also confirms that there is significant negative correlation between dust storm index and ISCCP cloud water path (CWP). These results suggest that dust aerosols warm clouds, increase the evaporation of cloud droplets and further reduce the CWP, the so-called semi-direct effect. The semi-direct effect may play a role in cloud development over arid and semi-arid areas of East Asia and contribute to the reduction of precipitation.

abstract = {Aerosol interaction with clouds is the main uncertainty for the quantification of the anthropogenic forcing on climate. The first step of the so-called "aerosol indirect effect" is the change of cloud droplet size distribution when seeded by anthropogenic aerosols. Satellite data provide the density and diversity of observations needed for a statistical estimate of this effect. Numerous such studies have demonstrated the correlation between aerosol load and Cloud Droplet Radius (CDR) and a few have quantified the impact of aerosol on the microphysics. Here, we go one step further by using the profiles from the spaceborne CALIPSO lidar that indicates the respective position of aerosol and cloud layers. The results show that, when aerosol and cloud layers are clearly separated, there is no correlation between aerosol load and CDR. On the other hand, when the lidar profile indicates mixing, there is a strong correlation. We focus on the stratocumulus cloud fields off the coast of Namibia and Angola that are seeded by biomass burning aerosols from Africa. The log-log slope of CDR and a proxy of the condensation nuclei number are-0.24 in excellent agreement with theoretical estimate. When the vertical profile information is not used, the slope is significantly smaller. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

As both reactions are acid-catalyzed it is very difficult to adjust the acidity distribution of a single catalyst to have a proper balance. In this work the used catalyst is a mixture of an isomerization catalyst (Pt/WO 3-ZrO 2) (PtWZ) and a cracking catalyst (Pt/SO 4 2--ZrO 2) (PtSZ), working at the same reaction conditions. The tests were performed using n-hexadecane as a model feedstock. The screening of pressure and temperature conditions indicates that the best match for both catalysts is 20 atm and 225 ??C. Stable activity levels for both catalysts can only be achieved at a H 2/n-C 16 ratio of 10. An adequate space velocity for increasing the yield to iC 5-9 and preventing consecutive cracking is 18.4 h - 1. At this process conditions mixtures (PtWZ + PtSZ) that contain 25{\%} or 50{\%} PtSZ have a better product distribution, with the maximum displaced to higher carbon numbers, with a reduced yield to isobutane and light gasses. Operation points lie on a monotonic curve of octane number gain (??RON) as a function of the yield of light gasses (C 1-4) that indicates that RON gains can only be obtained at the expense of the liquid yield. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study is aimed at a better understanding of how upstream runoffformation affected the cropping intensity (CI: Number of harvests) in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) between 2000 and 2012. MODIS 250 m NDVI time series and knowledge-based pixel masking that included settlement layers and topography features enabled to map the irrigated cropland extent (iCE). Random forest models supported the classification of cropland vegetation phenology (CVP: Winter/summer crops, double cropping, etc.). CI and the percentage of fallow cropland (PF) were derived from CVP. Spearman's rho was selected for assessing the statistical relation of CI and PF to runoffformation in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya catchments per hydrological year. Validation in 12 reference sites using multi-annual Landsat-7 ETM+ images revealed an average overall accuracy of 0.85 for the iCE maps. MODIS maps overestimated that based on Landsat by an average factor of {\~{}}1.15 (MODIS iCE/Landsat iCE). Exceptional overestimations occurred in case of inaccurate settlement layers. The CVP and CI maps achieved overall accuracies of 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. The Amu Darya catchment disclosed significant positive (negative) relations between upstream runoffwith CI (PF) and a high pressure on the river water resources in 2000-2012. Along the Syr Darya, reduced dependencies could be observed, which is potentially linked to the high number of water constructions in that catchment. Intensified double cropping after drought years occurred in Uzbekistan. However, a 10 km × 10 km grid of Spearman's rho (CI and PF vs. upstream runoff) emphasized locations at different CI levels that are directly affected by runofffluctuations in both river systems. The resulting maps may thus be supportive on the way to achieve long-term sustainability of crop production and to simultaneously protect the severely threatened environment in the ASB. The gained knowledge can be further used for investigating climatic impacts of irrigation in the region.},

This effect is investigated using a dynamic cloud model with detailed microphysics of both warm and ice phase processes. The model is initialized using measured size distributions and concentrations of mineral dust particles. Our results show that when dust appears at the cloud-base height and below 3 km, where the temperature is warmer than −5°C, the heating induced by the presence of dust layers can inhibit the formation of cloud droplets and suppresses the development of precipitation, leading to lower cloud optical depth and albedo. On the other hand, when the dust layers are located at altitudes with temperature colder than −5°C, or above the −5°C level, mineral aerosols can act as effective ice nuclei, intensify the ice-forming processes, and may enhance the development of cloud and precipitation. It is also found that the heating effect is more pronounced in continental clouds than in maritime clouds.},

Between 2006 and 2012 such a monitoring was carried out in the Turan lowland to analyze the effects of the newly formed Aralkum. The detected spatial and temporal dust deposition variability was significant and encourages further studies. The dust deposition increased over time, which correlates with a decreasing trend in precipitation, increasing wind speeds and a shift towards northern winds. More than 50{\%} of all dust samples collected exceed the health based deposition threshold and the most intense dust storm events reached ground level deposition rates of up to 150 g/m 2 per hour. This study showed the impact of the Aralkum, but also that the Kyzylkum is a far more active dust source.

Numerous fish and invertebrate introductions, many successful, have been made. In 1969, a dam impounding the Kapchagay reservoir was constructed on the River Ili, the major river flowing into the lake. The impoundment of water in this reservoir caused a fall of some 1.5 m in the water-level of the lake. This fall, together with other events on the catchment, caused considerable damage to reedswamps in the lake, to the fishery and to conservation values. A number of suggestions has been made on how to prevent further damage. Some, particularly those involving a moratorium on further filling of Kapchagay reservoir and irrigation, have been implemented, at least in part. This has caused some remission in environmental damage and provides for cautious optimism with regard to the lake's future. Even so, the environmental status of the lake remains vulnerable and many dangers persist. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

abstract = {Validation over heterogeneous areas is critical to ensuring the quality of remote sensing products. This paper focuses on the sampling methods used to validate the coarse-resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) product in the Heihe River Basin, where the patterns of spatial variations in and between land cover types vary significantly in the different growth stages of vegetation. A sampling method, called the mean of surface with non-homogeneity (MSN) method, and three other sampling methods are examined with real-world data obtained in 2012. A series of 15-m-resolution fractional vegetation cover reference maps were generated using the regressions of field-measured and satellite data. The sampling methods were tested using the 15-m-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover maps over a complete period of vegetation growth. Two scenes were selected to represent the situations in which sampling locations were sparsely and densely distributed. The results show that the FVCs estimated using the MSN method have errors of approximately less than 0.03 in the two selected scenes. The validation accuracy of the sampling methods varies with variations in the stratified non-homogeneity in the different growing stages of the vegetation. The MSN method, which considers both heterogeneity and autocorrelations between strata, is recommended for use in the determination of samplings prior to the design of an experimental campaign. In addition, the slight scaling bias caused by the non-linear relationship between NDVI and FVC samples is discussed. The positive or negative trend of the biases predicted using a Taylor expansion is found to be consistent with that of the real biases.},

In arid environments the exploration and monitoring of water resources is a prerequisite for water accessibility and rational use and management. To survey large arid areas for water, conventional land-based techniques must be complemented by using satellite and airborne remote sensors. Surface water systems can be mapped using multispectral and radar sensors; soil moisture in the unsaturated zone can be remotely sensed with microwave radiometers using indirect indicators, such as microwave emissivity; freshwater wetlands can be mapped using multispectral cameras; and freshwater springs can be detected using thermal infrared radiome-ters. Satellite remote sensors and satellite gravitational surveys can be used in combination with ancillary data analysis to infer groundwater behavior from surface expressions and to estimate groundwater aquifer storage. This chapter provides an overview of satellite and airborne remote sensing techniques for managing water resources and monitoring drought in arid and semiarid regions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. High spatial resolution hyperspectral data often used in precision farming applications are not available from current satellite sensors, and difficult or expensive to acquire from standard aircraft. Alternatively, in precision farming, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as lower cost and more flexible means to acquire very high resolution imagery. Miniaturized hyperspectral sensors have been developed for UAVs, but the sensors, associated hardware, and data processing software are still cost prohibitive for use by individual farmers or small remote sensing firms. This study simulated hyperspectral image data by fusing multispectral camera imagery and spectrometer data. We mounted a multispectral camera and spectrometer, both being low cost and low weight, on a standard UAV and developed procedures for their precise data alignment, followed by fusion of the spectrometer data with the image data to produce estimated spectra for all the multispectral camera image pixels. To align the data collected from the two sensors in both the time and space domains, a post-acquisition correlation-based global optimization method was used. Data fusion, to estimate hyperspectral reflectance, was implemented using several methods for comparison. Flight data from two crop sites, one being tomatoes, and the other corn and soybeans, were used to evaluate the alignment procedure and the data fusion results. The data alignment procedure resulted in a peak R 2 between the spectrometer and camera data of 0.95 and 0.72, respectively, for the two test sites. The corresponding multispectral camera data for these space and time offsets were taken as the best match to a given spectrometer reading, and used in modelling to estimate hyperspectral imagery from the multispectral camera pixel data. Of the fusion approaches evaluated, principal component analysis (PCA) based models and Bayesian imputation reached a similar accuracy, and outperformed simple spline interpolation. Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and observed spectra was 17{\%} relative to the mean of the observed spectra, and root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.028. This approach to deriving estimated hyperspectral image data can be applied in a simple fashion at very low cost for crop assessment and monitoring within individual fields.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. Collaboration between actors is an important determinant of water governance, particularly in developing countries suffering from lack of institutional and organizational performances for water management. The objective of this paper is to use the social network (SN) concept in bringing depth to the understanding of local irrigation governance in three irrigated schemes located in dry regions of southern Tunisia. Local stakeholders in the considered schemes interact around different water-related issues. These include authorizations for access to water, extension services for irrigated crops, training on the use of irrigation technologies, and finance and subsidies of irrigation water saving equipment. We considered each of these types of interactions as different tie and we mapped social networks around each of them. For each network, actors' densities, frequencies, and weight were reported. The results were revealing that better performances of water management are observed in areas with high SN density and high centrality of water users' associations. The relative “weights” of actors in the three considered areas were significantly different, indicating that the application of a standard decentralization process of irrigation water may result in different local organizational arrangements, depending on patterns of social interactions.},

Cook Agronomy Farm, USA. Performance of a random k-fold cross-validation (CV) was compared to three target-oriented strategies: Leave-Location-Out (LLO), Leave-Time-Out (LTO), and Leave-Location-and-Time-Out (LLTO) CV. Results indicate that considerable differences between random k-fold (R2 = 0.9 for Tair and 0.92 for VW) and target-oriented CV (LLO R2 = 0.24 for Tair and 0.49 for VW) exist, highlighting the need for target-oriented validation to avoid an overoptimistic view on models. Differences between random k-fold and target-oriented CV indicate spatial over-fitting caused by misleading variables. To decrease over-fitting, a forward feature selection in conjunction with target-oriented CV is proposed. It decreased over-fitting and simultaneously improved target-oriented performances (LLO CV R2 = 0.47 for Tair and 0.55 for VW).},

abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy combined with deep learning provide an automated and quantitative alternative to traditional histological examination. Current methods for cancer detection rely on tissue biopsy, chemical labeling/staining, and examination of the tissue by a pathologist. Though these methods continue to remain the gold standard, they are non-quantitative and susceptible to human error. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging has shown potential as a quantitative alternative to traditional histology. However, identification of histological components requires reliable classification based on molecular spectra, which are susceptible to artifacts introduced by noise and scattering. Several tissue types, particularly in heterogeneous tissue regions, tend to confound traditional classification methods. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art in image classification, providing the ability to learn spatial characteristics of images. In this paper, we demonstrate that CNNs with architectures designed to process both spectral and spatial information can significantly improve classifier performance over per-pixel spectral classification. We report classification results after applying CNNs to data from tissue microarrays (TMAs) to identify six major cellular and acellular constituents of tissue, namely adipocytes, blood, collagen, epithelium, necrosis, and myofibroblasts. Experimental results show that the use of spatial information in addition to the spectral information brings significant improvements in the classifier performance and allows classification of cellular subtypes, such as adipocytes, that exhibit minimal chemical information but have distinct spatial characteristics. This work demonstrates the application and efficiency of deep learning algorithms in improving the diagnostic techniques in clinical and research activities related to cancer. },

abstract = {Ontologies are used to model knowledge in several domains of interest, such as the biomedical domain. Conceptualization is the basic task for ontology building. Concepts are identified, and then they are linked through their semantic relationships. Recently, ontologies have constituted a crucial part of modern semantic webs because they can convert a web of documents into a web of things. Although ontology learning generally occupies a large space in computer science, Arabic ontology learning, in particular, is underdeveloped due to the Arabic language's nature as well as the profundity required in this domain. The previously published research on Arabic ontology learning from text falls into three categories: developing manually hand-crafted rules, using ordinary supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithms, or a hybrid of these two approaches. The model proposed in this work contributes to Arabic ontology learning in two ways. First, a text mining algorithm is proposed for extracting concepts and their semantic relations from text documents. The algorithm calculates the concept frequency weights using the term frequency weights. Then, it calculates the weights of concept similarity using the information of the ontology structure, involving (1) the concept's path distance, (2) the concept's distribution layer, and (3) the mutual parent concept's distribution layer. Then, feature mapping is performed by assigning the concepts' similarities to the concept features. Second, a hybrid genetic-whale optimization algorithm was proposed to optimize ontology learning from Arabic text. The operator of the G-WOA is a hybrid operator integrating GA's mutation, crossover, and selection processes with the WOA's processes (encircling prey, attacking of bubble-net, and searching for prey) to fulfill the balance between both exploitation and exploration, and to find the solutions that exhibit the highest fitness. For evaluating the performance of the ontology learning approach, extensive comparisons are conducted using different Arabic corpora and bio-inspired optimization algorithms. Furthermore, two publicly available non-Arabic corpora are used to compare the efficiency of the proposed approach with those of other languages. The results reveal that the proposed genetic-whale optimization algorithm outperforms the other compared algorithms across all the Arabic corpora in terms of precision, recall, and F-score measures. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of ontology learning from Arabic and non-Arabic texts in terms of these three measures.},

Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets.

The airborne laser scanning (ALS) method can be nowadays used to map complex areas and suitable complement earlier findings. This article describes visualization and image processing methods that can be applied on digital terrain models (DTMs) to highlight objects hidden in the landscape. Thanks to the analysis of visualized DTM it is possible to understand the landscape evolution including the differentiation between natural processes and human interventions. Different visualization methods were applied on a case study area. A system of parallel tracks hidden in a forest and its surroundings – part of old route called "Devil's Furrow" near the town of S{\'{a}}zava was chosen. The whole area around well known part of Devil's Furrow has not been prospected systematically yet. The data from the airborne laser scanning acquired by the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre was used. The average density of the point cloud was approximately 1 point/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} The goal of the project was to visualize the utmost smallest terrain discontinuities, e.g. tracks and erosion furrows, which some were not wholly preserved. Generally we were interested in objects that are clearly not visible in DTMs displayed in the form of shaded relief. Some of the typical visualization methods were tested (shaded relief, aspect and slope image). To get better results we applied image-processing methods that were successfully used on aerial photographs or hyperspectral images in the past. The usage of different visualization techniques on one site allowed us to verify the natural character of the southern part of Devil's Furrow and find formations up to now hidden in the forests.},

This is one of the major paradigms that have emerged in the face of enduring questions regarding how best to govern water supply systems in developing countries. In the paper, we postulate that increasing pressure on available natural resources may have already rendered obsolete some of the water supply governance regimes that have served human societies very well for many decades. Our main findings show that national and municipal water supply governance paradigms tend to change in tandem with emerging national development frameworks and priorities. While many developing countries have adopted water management and governance policy prescriptions from the international arena, national and local socioeconomic and political realities ultimately determine what works and what does not work on the ground. We thus, conclude that the choice of what constitutes an appropriate water supply governance regime in context is never simple. Indeed, the majority of case studies reviewed in the paper tend to rely on a mix of market economics and developmental statism to make their water governance regimes more realistic and workable on the ground.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles have become a popular remote sensing platform for agricultural applications, with an emphasis on crop monitoring. Although there are several methods to detect vegetation through aerial imagery, these remain dependent of manual extraction of vegetation parameters. This article presents an automatic method that allows for individual tree detection and multi-temporal analysis, which is crucial in the detection of missing and new trees and monitoring their health conditions over time. The proposed method is based on the computation of vegetation indices (VIs), while using visible (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) domain combination bands combined with the canopy height model. An overall segmentation accuracy above 95{\%} was reached, even when RGB-based VIs were used. The proposed method is divided in three major steps: (1) segmentation and first clustering; (2) cluster isolation; and (3) feature extraction. This approach was applied to several chestnut plantations and some parameters—such as the number of trees present in a plantation (accuracy above 97{\%}), the canopy coverage (93{\%} to 99{\%} accuracy), the tree height (RMSE of 0.33 m and R2 = 0.86), and the crown diameter (RMSE of 0.44 m and R2 = 0.96)—were automatically extracted. Therefore, by enabling the substitution of time-consuming and costly field campaigns, the proposed method represents a good contribution in managing chestnut plantations in a quicker and more sustainable way.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The use of remote sensing data for tree species classification in tropical forests is still a challenging task, due to their high floristic and spectral diversity. In this sense, novel sensors on board of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms are a rapidly evolving technology that provides new possibilities for tropical tree species mapping. Besides the acquisition of high spatial and spectral resolution images, UAV-hyperspectral cameras operating in frame format enable to produce 3D hyperspectral point clouds. This study investigated the use of UAV-acquired hyperspectral images and UAV-photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) for classification of 12 major tree species in a subtropical forest fragment in Southern Brazil. Different datasets containing hyperspectral visible/near-infrared (VNIR) bands, PPC features, canopy height model (CHM), and other features extracted from hyperspectral data (i.e., texture, vegetation indices-VIs, and minimum noise fraction-MNF) were tested using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results showed that the use of VNIR hyperspectral bands alone reached an overall accuracy (OA) of 57{\%} (Kappa index of 0.53). Adding PPC features to the VNIR hyperspectral bands increased the OA by 11{\%}. The best result was achieved combining VNIR bands, PPC features, CHM, and VIs (OA of 72.4{\%} and Kappa index of 0.70). When only the CHM was added to VNIR bands, the OA increased by 4.2{\%}. Among the hyperspectral features, besides all the VNIR bands and the two VIs (NDVI and PSSR), the first four MNF features and the textural mean of 565 and 679 nm spectral bands were pointed out as more important to discriminate the tree species according to Jeffries–Matusita (JM) distance. The SVM method proved to be a good classifier for the tree species recognition task, even in the presence of a high number of classes and a small dataset.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Characterising microplastics based on spectroscopic measurements is one key step of many studies that analyse the fate of microplastics in the environment. Over the years, many potential sources of error were identified, which can be seen by the implementation of anti-contamination protocols, measuring laboratory blanks or using less aggressive chemicals for sample purification. However, the identification process itself in the meaning of a traceable and transparent documentation is hard to find in many research studies. Unfortunately, this can make it difficult to estimate if the presented results are representative and reproducible, as the evaluation process during microplastics identification depends dramatically on the performed data treatment. To increase the awareness of this often neglected topic, this article reviews suitable data preprocessing and evaluation methods for microplastics identification based on spectroscopic measurements and will recommend a practical workflow or check list that can easily be used for further research studies.},

abstract = {The measurement of tree height has long been an important tree attribute for the purpose of calculating tree growth, volume, and biomass, which in turn deliver important ecological and economical information to decision makers. Tree height has traditionally been measured by indirect field-based techniques, however these methods are rarely contested. With recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technologies, the possibility to acquire accurate tree heights semi-automatically has become a reality. In this study, photogrammetric and field-based tree height measurements of a Scots Pine stand were validated using destructive methods. The intensive forest monitoring site implemented for the study was configured with permanent ground control points (GCPs) measured with a Total Station (TS). Field-based tree height measurements resulted in a similar level of error to that of the photogrammetric measurements, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.304 m (1.82{\%}) and 0.34 m (2.07{\%}), respectively (n = 34). A conflicting bias was, however, discovered where field measurements tended to overestimate tree heights and photogrammetric measurements were underestimated. The photogrammetric tree height measurements of all trees (n = 285) were validated against the field-based measurements and resulted in a RMSE of 0.479 m (2.78{\%}). Additionally, two separate photogrammetric tree height datasets were compared (n = 251), and a very low amount of error was observed with a RMSE of 0.138 m (0.79{\%}), suggesting a high potential for repeatability. This study shows that UAV photogrammetric tree height measurements are a viable option for intensive forest monitoring plots and that the possibility to acquire within-season tree growth measurements merits further study. Additionally, it was shown that negative and positive biases evident in field-based and UAV-based photogrammetric tree height measurements could potentially lead to misinterpretation of results when field-based measurements are used as validation.},

abstract = {The decrease of river runoff draining into Lake Balkhash in Central Asia was investigated using hydrological and meteorological data over a long-term period. The data from the difference integral curves of the annual runoff from 1911 to 1986 suggested that a low-flow period began in 1970 in the River Ili, and in 1973 in the east rivers, continuing until 1986. Compared with the runoff before 1969, the decrease of runoff in the upper reaches of the River Ili was less than those in the middle and lower reaches. The decrease in the upper reaches resulted from natural variability, whereas those of the middle and lower reaches were due to a combination of the effects of climate and human activity. There are two reasons for this. First, after 1970, precipitation did not decrease uniformly across the entire basin. Second, in 1970, the Kapchagay dam started operating. As a result, the annual inflow into Lake Balkhash from the River Ili after 1970 decreased to 77{\%} of the pre-1969 mean. Similarly, after 1973, the inflow from the east rivers was 75{\%} of the pre-1972 mean. The characteristics of the runoff in the growing season (April to September) and those in the non-growing season (October to March) were investigated for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the River Ili. In all reaches, the runoff in the non-growing season remained unchanged both before and after 1969. However, from 1970 to 1986, decreases of river flow in the growing season were 2{\textperiodcentered}0 to 2{\textperiodcentered}5 times greater in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches. This was primarily due to the impacts of human activity. In conclusion, it can be deduced that the decrease in runoff after 1970 in the middle and lower reaches was the result of human activity during the low-flow period.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of water depletion in the irrigated land of Khorezm, a region located in Central Asia in the lower floodplains of the Amu Darya River, were mapped and monitored by means of MODIS land products. Land cover and land use were classified by using a recursive partitioning and regression tree with 250 m MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETact) was obtained by applying the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to 1 km daily MODIS data. Elements of the SEBAL based METRIC model (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) were adopted and modified. The upstream–downstream difference in irrigation was reflected by analyzing agricultural land use and amounts of depleted water (ETact) using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The validity of the MODIS albedo and emissivity used for modeling ETact was assessed with data extracted from literature. The r 2 value of 0.6 indicated a moderate but significant association between ETact and class-A-pan evaporation. Deviations of ETact from the 10-day reference evapotranspiration of wheat and cotton were found to be explainable. In Khorezm, seasonal maximum values superior to 1,200 and 1,000 mm ETact were estimated for rice and cotton fields, respectively. Spatio-temporal comparisons of agricultural land use with seasonal ETact disclosed unequal water consumption in Khorezm. Seasonal ETact on agricultural land decreased with increasing distance to the water intake points of the irrigation system (972–712 mm). Free MODIS data provided reliable, exhaustive, and consistent information on water use relevant for decision support in Central Asian water management.},

The application of the two techniques, though similar, yielded results that represent different chemical properties of the polymeric substances. On one hand, correlation-PCA enabled the classification of the fabric materials according to the organic functional groups of their repeating monomer units. On the other hand, covariance-PCA was used to classify the fabric materials primarily according to their origins; natural (animal or plant) or synthetic. Hence besides major chemical functional groups of the repeat units, it appears covariance-PCA is also sensitive to other characteristic chemical (inorganic and/or organic) or biochemical material inclusions that are found in different samples. We therefore recommend the application of both covariance-PCA and correlation-PCA on datasets, whenever applicable, to enable a broader classification of spectroscopic information through data mining and exploration.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the main sources of variation in the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of 329 wines of various styles. The FT-IR spectra were gathered using a specialized WineScan instrument. The main sources of variation included the reducing sugar and alcohol content of the samples, as well as the stage of fermentation and the maturation period of the wines. The implications of the variation between the different wine styles for the design of calibration models with accurate predictive abilities were investigated using glycerol calibration in wine as a model system. PCA enabled the identification and interpretation of samples that were poorly predicted by the calibration models, as well as the detection of individual samples in the sample set that had atypical spectra (i.e., outlier samples). The Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) approach was used to establish a model for the classification of the outlier samples. A glycerol calibration for wine was developed (reducing sugar content {\textless} 30 g/L, alcohol {\textgreater} 8{\%} v/v) with satisfactory predictive ability (SEP = 0.40 g/L). The RPD value (ratio of the standard deviation of the data to the standard error of prediction) was 5.6, indicating that the calibration is suitable for quantification purposes. A calibration for glycerol in special late harvest and noble late harvest wines (RS 31-147 g/L, alcohol {\textgreater} 11.6{\%} v/v) with a prediction error SECV = 0.65 g/L, was also established. This study yielded an analytical strategy that combined the careful design of calibration sets with measures that facilitated the early detection and interpretation of poorly predicted samples and outlier samples in a sample set. The strategy provided a powerful means of quality control, which is necessary for the generation of accurate prediction data and therefore for the successful implementation of FT-IR in the routine analytical laboratory.},

abstract = {Structural analysis of forests by UAV is currently growing in popularity. Given the reduction in platform costs, and the number of algorithms available to analyze data output, the number of applications has grown rapidly. Forest structures are not only linked to economic value in forestry, but also to biodiversity and vulnerability issues. LiDAR remains the most promising technique for forest structural assessment, but small LiDAR sensors suitable for UAV applications are expensive and are limited to a few manufactures. The estimation of 3D-structures from two-dimensional image sequences called {\&}lsquo;Structure from motion{\&}rsquo; (SfM) overcomes this limitation by photogrammetrically reconstructing point clouds similar to those rendered from LiDAR sensors. The result of these techniques in highly structured terrain strongly depends on the methods employed during image acquisition, therefore structural indices might be vulnerable to misspecifications in flight campaigns. In this paper, we outline how image overlap and ground sampling distances affect image reconstruction completeness in 2D and 3D. Higher image overlaps and coarser GSDs have a clearly positive influence on reconstruction quality. Therefore, higher accuracy requirements in the GSD must be compensated by a higher image overlap. The best results are achieved with an image overlap of {\textgreater} 95{\%} and a resolution of {\textgreater} 5 cm. The most important environmental factors have been found to be wind and terrain elevation, which could be an indicator of vegetation density.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. In recent years, sequential tests for detecting structural changes in time series have been adapted for deforestation monitoring using satellite data. The input time series of such sequential tests is typically a vegetation index (e.g., NDVI), which uses two or three bands and ignores all other bands. Being limited to a vegetation index will not benefit from the richer spectral information provided by newly launched satellites and will bring two bottle-necks for deforestation monitoring. Firstly, it is hard to select a suitable vegetation index a priori. Secondly, a single vegetation index is typically affected by seasonal signals, noise and other natural dynamics, which decrease its power for deforestation detection. A novel multispectral time series change monitoring method that combines dimension reduction methods with a sequential hypothesis test is proposed to address these limitations. For each location, the proposed method automatically chooses a "suitable" index for deforestation monitoring. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented it in two study areas: a dry tropical forest in Bolivia (time series length: 444) with strong seasonality and a moist tropical forest in Brazil (time series length: 225) with almost no seasonality. Our method significantly improves accuracy in the presence of strong seasonality, in particular the temporal lag between disturbance and its detection.},

abstract = {Micro-plastics dispersion in water is one of the major global threats due to the potential of plastic items to affect the food chain and reproduction of marine organisms. However, reliable and automatic recognition of micro-plastic in water is still an unmatched goal. Here we identify micro-plastics in water samples through digital holography microscopy combined to machine learning. We exploit the rich content of information of the holographic signature to design new distinctive features that specifically characterize micro-plastics and allow distinguishing them from marine plankton of comparable size. We use these features to train a plain support vector machine, remarkably improving its performance. Thus, we obtain a very accurate classifier using a simple machine learning approach, which does not require a large amount of training data and identifies micro-plastics of various morphology and optical properties over a wide range of characteristic scales. This is a first mandatory step to develop sensor networks to map the distribution of micro-plastics in water and their flows.},

abstract = {Central Asia's Ili River is fed by mountain streams that flow down into an isolated and arid basin that today is shared by Kazakhstan and China. Agriculture in the basin is dependent upon irrigation, which was practiced as long ago as the Iron Age, when early pastoralists constructed ditches to channel water from streams onto nearby fields. Irrigation had become much more common by the 18th century, when the region was controlled by the Dzungarian Khanate. The khanate was toppled by the Qing Chinese in the 1750s in the first of a series of confrontations that destroyed and then rebuilt the basin's agricultural economy. The region has since been dominated by a succession of Chinese and Russian (and later Soviet and independent Kazakh) governments, each of which recognized the essential role of irrigated agriculture in maintaining control. Thus every cycle of destruction led to reclamation of new lands, resettlement of farmers and upgrading of infrastructure to expand irrigation. This allowed an impressive diversity of fruits, vegetables and field crops to be grown, especially on loess soils of the more fertile upper basin, where tributaries could be easily tapped by gravity flow. Many of these tributaries were entirely diverted by the 19th century, so that they no longer reached the Ili. Large scale irrigation commenced in the 1960s, when the Soviets built Kapchagai dam and reservoir in the lower part of the basin and installed pumps to raise water from the Ili River onto nearby reclaimed sierozem soils, mostly for cultivation of rice. China later constructed a cluster of small- and medium-sized dams that enabled expansion of agriculture in the upper part of the basin. Many irrigated areas along the lower reaches of the Ili in Kazakhstan have been abandoned, but irrigation in the upper basin continues to expand. Declining soil fertility, salinization, pollution, insufficient inflows and adverse economic conditions currently challenge irrigation across the entire basin. Investments are being made in new technologies as a means to sustain irrigated agriculture in the basin, but it remains to be seen if these strategies will be successful.},

Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to measure the qualitative parameters of waterbodies (i.e., suspended sediments, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a, and pollutants). A large number of different sensors on board various satellites and other platforms, such as airplanes, are currently used to measure the amount of radiation at different wavelengths reflected from the water's surface. In this review paper, various properties (spectral, spatial and temporal, etc.) of the more commonly employed spaceborne and airborne sensors are tabulated to be used as a sensor selection guide.

The parameters include: chlorophyll-a (chl-a), colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM), Secchi disk depth (SDD), turbidity, total suspended sediments (TSS), water temperature (WT), total phosphorus (TP), sea surface salinity (SSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).},

abstract = {Microplastics (MP) and microfibers (MF), were simultaneously identified and quantified by data analysis of FTIR imaging measurements. The ubiquitous presence of microlitter (ML), precisely microplastics (MP) and microfibres (MF) in the global environment is of growing concern for science, and society in general. Reliable methods are urgently needed for the identification and quantification of these emerging environmental pollutants. Recently a rapid Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging pipeline was developed for automated identification and quantification of MP. However, although the usefulness for the quantification of MP could already be shown in several studies, microfibres could not be targeted so far by the developed analysis pipeline. In this study we present a novel approach for the simultaneous identification and quantification of MP and MF. By concentrating the sample on membrane filters and applying a BaF 2 window on top of the filter, all objects – including MF – are fixed in the focal plane of the FTIR microscope. Furthermore, the analysis pipeline was augmented with algorithms which take into consideration the filamentous structure of MF. The novel analysis pipeline now allows to separate MP and MF via a preselection of fibres from the dataset by object size and shape. MP and MF are subsequently further investigated for specific polymer types and lengths/sizes. After parameter optimization the newly developed analysis approach was applied to archived samples from previous studies on treated waste water. The results were compared with respect to the original detected polymer types and numbers, but also considered MF detection. },

For samples with r {\textless} 0.8 we determined the Mahalanobis Distance (MD) as additional tool of identification. For instance, for the four plastic fragments found in the Carretta carretta, one plastic sample was assigned to OPE due to its r = 0.87; for all the other three plastic samples, due to the r values ranging between 0.83 and0.70, the support of MD suggested LDPET and OPE as co-polymer constituents.},

abstract = {Over the past years Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a prospective tool for cancer diagnostics. In order to apply FTIR spectroscopy as a routine tool for biomedical diagnostics of tissue samples, strong and reliable classifiers are needed. Frequently, the number of available tissue samples is restricted and due to that data sets consist of a small number of samples, often less than 100. This can result in unstable classifiers, which perform poorly on unseen data. In this work we present a way to overcome this limitation by aggregating several support vector machines in to an ensemble. Different ensemble systems, including bagging, boosting and tree-based models, were investigated for a FTIR data set acquired from different types and stages of breast cancer. It was found that an ensemble system predicts 88.9{\%} of the unseen multi-class test set correctly. In comparison a single classifier only achieved a predictive performance of 66.7{\%}. As these results show, the application of SVM ensembles in biomedical diagnostics using FTIR spectroscopy can be highly beneficial. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Through surveying effects of parameters such as surface contamination, sample thickness, label and cap existence, it was obvious that the "Two-Filter" method has a high efficiency in identification of resins.

For the multivariate analysis principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), interval principal component analysis (iPCA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) were used. The results indicate that is possible to develop a methodology to identify vegetable oils used as raw material in the production of biodiesel by FTIR-UATR applying multivariate analysis.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to widespread abandonment of agricultural lands, but the extent and spatial patterns of abandonment are unclear. We quantified the extent of abandoned farmland, both croplands and pastures, across the region using MODIS NDVI satellite image time series from 2004 to 2006 and support vector machine classifications. Abandoned farmland was widespread, totaling 52.5 Mha, particularly in temperate European Russia (32 Mha), northern and western Ukraine, and Belarus. Differences in abandonment rates among countries were striking, suggesting that institutional and socio-economic factors were more important in determining the amount of abandonment than biophysical conditions. Indeed, much abandoned farmland occurred in areas without major constraints for agriculture. Our map provides a basis for assessing the potential of Central and Eastern Europe's abandoned agricultural lands to contribute to food or bioenergy production, or carbon storage, as well as the environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.},

abstract = {Abstract Further cropland expansion might be unavoidable to satisfy the growing demand for land-based products and ecosystem services. A crucial issue is thus to assess the trade-offs between social and ecological impacts and the benefits of converting additional land to cropland. In the former Soviet Union countries, where the transition from state-command to market-driven economies resulted in widespread agricultural land abandonment, cropland expansion may incur relatively low costs, especially compared with tropical regions. Our objectives were to quantify the drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland to assess the potentially available cropland in European Russia, western Siberia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan—the region where the vast majority of post-Soviet cropland abandonment took place. Using spatial panel regressions, we characterized the socio-economic determinants of cropland abandonment and recultivation. We then used recent maps of changes in cropland to (i) spatially characterize the socio-economic, accessibility and soil constraints associated with the recultivation of abandoned croplands and (ii) investigate the environmental trade-offs regarding carbon stocks and habitat for biodiversity. Less cropland abandonment and more recultivation after 2000 occurred in areas with an increasing rural population and a younger labor force, but also improved yields. Synergies were observed between cropland recultivation and intensification over the 2000s. From 47.3million hectares (Mha) of cropland abandoned in 2009, we identified only 8.5 (7.1–17.4)Mha of potentially available cropland with low environmental trade-offs and low to moderate socio-economic or accessibility constraints that were located on high-quality soils (Chernozems). These areas represented an annual wheat production potential of ∼14.3 (9.6–19.5)million tons (Mt). Conversely, 8.5 (4.2–12.4)Mha had high carbon or biodiversity trade-offs, of which ∼10{\%} might be attractive for cropland expansion and thus would require protection from recultivation. Agro-environmental, accessibility, and socio-economic constraints suggested that the remaining 30.6 (25.7–30.6)Mha of abandoned croplands were unlikely to provide important contributions to future crop production at current wheat prices but could provide various ecosystem services, and some could support extensive livestock production. Political and institutional support could foster recultivation by supporting investments in agriculture and rural demographic revitalization. Reclaiming potentially available cropland in the study region could provide a notable contribution to global grain production, with relatively low environmental trade-offs compared with tropical frontiers, but is not a panacea to address global issues of food security or reduce land-use pressure on tropical ecosystems.},

Microplastics have become a major global environmental issue in recent decades due to their ubiquity in the oceans, bioavailability and ability to carry toxic chemicals. Analysis of microplastics in environmental and experimental samples has become increasingly common. We conducted a literature survey to review the current identification methods for microplastics. The advantages and limitations of each identification method were compared to indicate the best methods for microplastic analysis. Identification of microplastics is based on the physical and chemical characterisation of isolated particles in mixtures of inorganic and organic remnant particles after the extraction and clean-up steps. In addition, novel methods which may possibly be applied to microplastic identification were suggested. Microscopic identification by itself has a high risk of producing both false positive and false negative results in analyses of small microplastics. At present, combinations of physical ( e.g., microscopy) and chemical ( e.g., spectroscopy) analyses are widely used. However, there is a need to improve and develop new methods to reduce the identification time and effort and to detect sub-micron plastics in environmental samples. },

A total of 371 American participants were exposed to one of two frames to test their effect on public attitudes towards civil liberties and Muslims, and support for counterterrorism policies. Results show that the "domestic homegrown" frame produces greater increases in fear than the "international" frame. This leads to greater support for restricting civil liberties of Muslims and, under certain circumstances, general feelings of negativity toward Muslims. The study also finds support for the hydraulic effect of framing in that the domestic homegrown frame suppresses party identification in attitude formation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright National Communication Association.},

abstract = {Quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) derived from weather radars provide spatially and temporally highly resolved rainfall data. However, they are also subject to systematic and random bias and various potential uncertainties and therefore require thorough quality checks before usage. The dataset described in this paper is a collection of precipitation statistics calculated from the hourly nationwide German RADKLIM and RADOLAN QPEs provided by the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)), which were combined with rainfall statistics derived from rain gauge data for intercomparison. Moreover, additional information on parameters that can potentially influence radar data quality, such as the height above sea level, information on wind energy plants and the distance to the next radar station, were included in the dataset. The resulting two point shapefiles are readable with all common GIS and constitutes a spatially highly resolved rainfall statistics geodataset for the period 2006 to 2017, which can be used for statistical rainfall analyses or for the derivation of model inputs. Furthermore, the publication of this data collection has the potential to benefit other users who intend to use precipitation data for any purpose in Germany and to identify the rainfall dataset that is best suited for their application by a straightforward comparison of three rainfall datasets without any tedious data processing and georeferencing.},

abstract = {Land use classification is an important part of many remote sensing applications. A lot of research has gone into the application of statistical and neural network classifiers to remote-sensing images. This research involves the study and implementation of a new pattern recognition technique introduced within the framework of statistical learning theory called Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and its application to remote-sensing image classification. Standard classifiers such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) need a number of training samples that exponentially increase with the dimension of the input feature space. With a limited number of training samples, the classification rate thus decreases as the dimensionality increases. SVMs are independent of the dimensionality of feature space as the main idea behind this classification technique is to separate the classes with a surface that maximizes the margin between them, using boundary pixels to create the decision surface. Results from SVMs are compared with traditional Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and an ANN classifier. The findings suggest that the ANN and SVM classifiers perform better than the traditional MLC. The SVM and the ANN show comparable results. However, accuracy is dependent on factors such as the number of hidden nodes (in the case of ANN) and kernel parameters (in the case of SVM). The training time taken by the SVM is several magnitudes less.},

A content analysis of news articles about biofuels from three newspapers—the  Des Moines Register, the Cedar Rapids Gazette and the Davenport Quad City Times—published over a one-year period was conducted to determine media frames. A mail survey of residents of the three cities where the newspapers are published—Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport—was done to elicit audience frames.    The findings show support for the framing theory proposition that media frames influence audience frames, based on the substantial overlap between the two. The news reports, however, were neutral while the respondents were very positive about the topic. The results indicate that while the media may be successful in telling people what to think about and how to think about those topics, they may not be too successful in influencing their attitudes about them.},

This study revealed the characteristics of climate change and abrupt change points of precipitation and temperature during different time scales in the Ili River Basin within the past 50 years. The results showed that the precipitation increased from the mid-1980s until 2000 and has continued to increase at a smaller magnitude since 2000. Over the studied period, the precipitation increased significantly during the summer and winter months. The temperature increased greatly in the late 1980s, and has continued to show an increasing trend from the year 2000 to present. The temperature increases were most significant during the summer, autumn and winter months. In terms of different geographies, the temperature increase was significant during the winter in the plains and hilly regions; the increase was also significant during autumn in the intermontane basins. The climate change trends in the Ili River Basin were consistent with the changing trends of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the plateau monsoon. {\textcopyright} 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Water resources in dry areas in Tunisia are under strong pressure, which seriously threatens their sustainability. This situation may get worse over the years, especially with the climate change and the intensification of agricultural practices, if the concretes measures are not taken into account. Water pricing has been a key of the water policy in Tunisia for the last two decades to saving water. It depended on the characteristics of the irrigated farming in these dry areas. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of water-policy on water demand for the farming in three different public irrigated systems. Bio-economic model, such as Farming System SIMulator (FSSIM), has been applied for this impact analysis. The main results from the analysis of the demand curve show that the flexibility of the crop plan and competition between irrigated crops are linked to the land constraint, in particular irrigable land. These results show also that the determination of an incentive price for the use of new irrigation technologies is located on the segment where the function of the demand is elastic. In this segment, the farmer's behavior becomes more rational to save water in arid zones like in the south of Tunisia where the water is a limiting factor for the irrigated agriculture.},

abstract = {Earth observation data cubes are increasingly used as a data structure to make large collections of satellite images easily accessible to scientists. They hide complexities in the data such that data users can concentrate on the analysis rather than on data management. However, the construction of data cubes is not trivial and involves decisions that must be taken with regard to any particular analyses. This paper proposes on-demand data cubes, which are constructed on the fly when data users process the data. We introduce the open-source C++ library and R package gdalcubes for the construction and processing of on-demand data cubes from satellite image collections, and show how it supports interactive method development workflows where data users can initially try methods on small subsamples before running analyses on high resolution and/or large areas. Two study cases, one on processing Sentinel-2 time series and the other on combining vegetation, land surface temperature, and precipitation data, demonstrate and evaluate this implementation. While results suggest that on-demand data cubes implemented in gdalcubes support interactivity and allow for combining multiple data products, the speed-up effect also strongly depends on how original data products are organized. The potential for cloud deployment is discussed.},

SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS The reliability of clinicians' ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis and the interpretation of examination findings. Often, these ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal scale. For such data, the kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability. Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence, bias, and non-independent ratings) are discussed, and ways of evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered. The issue of statistical testing of kappa is considered, including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated. CONCLUSIONS The article concludes with recommendations for the use and interpretation of kappa.},

abstract = {More than 40{\%} of irrigation water currently used in Tunisia is provided by groundwater aquifers, most of which are in a critical state of depletion due to its overexploitation during the last three decades. This paper provides a critical assessment of groundwater management in Tunisia based on interviews with key officials from central and regional administrations, in addition to farmers' questionnaires regarding attitudes and perceptions about different groundwater management instruments. Even though there is a consistent official groundwater management strategy in Tunisia, its enforcement is still problematic. Many regulatory and incentive instruments were adopted to manage groundwater but their effect was limited, partly due to the weak implementation capacities of the regional and local water administrations. Moreover, most farmers are not aware about the critical situation of this common pool resource and self-regulation initiatives are almost absent. From this assessment, we mainly conclude that the remaining activities for enhancing groundwater governance in Tunisia needs to rely on two main axes. The first is related to the improvement of administrative performances, particularly those for horizontal coordination of groundwater. The second is about investing in enhancing social capital supporting institutional changes; which is particularly necessary for the promotion of self-regulation initiatives. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2014.},

abstract = {The reflectance spectrum of species in a hyperspectral data can be modelled as an n-dimensional vector. A spectral angle mapper (SAM) computes the angle between the vectors that is used to discriminate the species. Spectral information divergence (SID) models the data as a probability distribution so that the spectral variability between the bands can be extracted using stochastic measures. The hybrid approach of the SAM and SID is found to be a better discriminator than the SAM or SID on their own. The spectral correlation angle (SCA) is computed as a cosine of the angle of the Pearsonian correlation coefficient between the vectors. The SCA is a better measure than the SAM as it considers only standardized values of the vector rather than the absolute values of the vector. In the present article, we propose a new hybrid measure based on the SCA and the SID. The proposed method has been compared with the hybrid approach of the SID and SAM for discriminating species belonging to Vigna genus using measures such as relative spectral discriminatory power, relative discriminatory probability and relative discriminatory entropy in different spectral regions. Experimental results using the laboratory spectra show that the proposed method gives higher relative discriminatory power in the 400-700 nm spectral region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Water withdrawals are increasing to the extent that they are beginning to threaten the ecosystem, just as it is becoming stressed by altered inflows as glaciers retreat and disappear. If the Ili River ecosystem is to be preserved, it is crucial that we thoroughly understand the spatial and temporal nuances of the interrelationships between water, energy, and foodand the vulnerability of these components to climate change. The ecosystem has all of the characteristics of a classically-defined wicked problem, and so it warrants treatment as a complex and dynamic challenge subject to changing assumptions, unexpected consequences, and strong social and economic overtones. Research should thus focus not just on new knowledge about the water, energy, or food component, but on advancing our understanding of the ecosystem as a whole.

abstract = {Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has long been established as an analytical technique for the measurement of vibrational modes of molecular systems. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has long been established as an analytical technique for the measurement of vibrational modes of molecular systems. More recently, FTIR has been used for the analysis of biofluids with the aim of becoming a tool to aid diagnosis. For the clinician, this represents a convenient, fast, non-subjective option for the study of biofluids and the diagnosis of disease states. The patient also benefits from this method, as the procedure for the collection of serum is much less invasive and stressful than traditional biopsy. This is especially true of patients in whom brain cancer is suspected. A brain biopsy is very unpleasant for the patient, potentially dangerous and can occasionally be inconclusive. We therefore present a method for the diagnosis of brain cancer from serum samples using FTIR and machine learning techniques. The scope of the study involved 433 patients from whom were collected 9 spectra each in the range 600–4000 cm −1 . To begin the development of the novel method, various pre-processing steps were investigated and ranked in terms of final accuracy of the diagnosis. Random forest machine learning was utilised as a classifier to separate patients into cancer or non-cancer categories based upon the intensities of wavenumbers present in their spectra. Generalised 2D correlational analysis was then employed to further augment the machine learning, and also to establish spectral features important for the distinction between cancer and non-cancer serum samples. Using these methods, sensitivities of up to 92.8{\%} and specificities of up to 91.5{\%} were possible. Furthermore, ratiometrics were also investigated in order to establish any correlations present in the dataset. We show a rapid, computationally light, accurate, statistically robust methodology for the identification of spectral features present in differing disease states. With current advances in IR technology, such as the development of rapid discrete frequency collection, this approach is of importance to enable future clinical translation and enables IR to achieve its potential. },

abstract = {Water pollution such as green algae blooms and eutrophication in freshwater fatally influences both water quality and human society. Water quality issues in the 4 major rivers in Korea, including the Nakdong, have recently become a major concern. For this reason, it is essential to monitor water quality parameters (WQPs) that have a widespread characteristic to ensure maintenance of an effective water management system. The possibility of utilizing remote sensing technology for monitoring water quality on a regional scale has been recently investigated. The main objective of this study is to evaluate potential applications of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for estimating water quality in the Nakdong River, Korea. Correlations between Landsat 8 bands and in situ measurements are determined, and water quality models are established for estimating suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total phosphorus (TP). The results demonstrate that WQPs correlated well with band reflectance values from Landsat 8. Band 5 was reasonably correlated with all WQPs, particularly with SS (R = -0.74) and Chl-a (R = -0.71). This study constructed multiple regression equations for WQPs based on correlation analysis through band combination and band ratio. The spatial distribution of WQPs in the Nakdong River on October 27, 2013 and May 16, 2014 indicate that the river was nearly eutrophic from human activities. Based on the results, the Landsat 8 OLI may be an appropriate data for estimating and monitoring water quality parameters on a regional scale. However, further validation is required to support the findings of this study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing. All Rights Reserved. Microplastics in aquatic ecosystems and especially in the marine environment represent a pollution of increasing scientific and societal concern, thus, recently a substantial number of studies on microplastics were published. Although first steps towards a standardization of methodologies used for the detection and identification of microplastics in environmental samples are made, the comparability of data on microplastics is currently hampered by a huge variety of different methodologies, which result in the generation of data of extremely different quality and resolution. This chapter reviews the methodology presently used for assessing the concentration of microplastics in the marine environment with a focus on the most convenient techniques and approaches. After an overview of non-selective sampling approaches, sample processing and treatment in the laboratory, the reader is introduced to the currently applied techniques for the identification and quantification of microplastics. The subsequent case study on microplastics in sediment samples from the North Sea measured with focal plane array (FPA)-based micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy shows that only 1.4 {\%} of the particles visually resembling microplastics were of synthetic polymer origin. This finding emphasizes the importance of verifying the synthetic polymer origin of potential microplastics. Thus, a burning issue concerning current microplastic research is the generation of standards that allow for the assessment of reliable data on concentrations of microscopic plastic particles and the involved polymers with analytical laboratory techniques such as micro-FTIR or micro-Raman spectroscopy.},

It was observed that evergreen forest sites are always followed by deciduous forest sites in all phenological events. The season starts by August and ends by June the following year in evergreen forests. In deciduous forests, the season starts by May and ends by March the following year. Evergreen forests have longer season than deciduous forests. Maximum temperature and rainfall have negative (r = -0.785) and positive (r = 0.502) correlation respectively with start of the season. However, maximum temperature has high positive correlation (r = 0.942) with leaf senescence.

abstract = {Crop mapping is one major component of agricultural resource monitoring using remote sensing. Yield or water demand modeling requires that both, the total surface that is cultivated and the accurate distribution of crops, respectively is known. Map quality is crucial and influences the model outputs. Although the use of multi-spectral time series data in crop mapping has been acknowledged, the potentially high dimensionality of the input data remains an issue. In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3{\%}, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection. Uncertainty measures from SVM are an informative source of information on the spatial distribution of error in the crop maps. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {With the recession of the Aral Sea in Central Asia, once the world's fourth largest lake, a huge new saline desert emerged which is nowadays called the Aralkum. Saline soils in the Aralkum are a major source for dust and salt storms in the region. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal land cover change dynamics in the Aralkum and discuss potential implications for the recent and future dust and salt storm activity in the region. MODIS satellite time series were classified from 2000--2008 and change of land cover was quantified. The Aral Sea desiccation accelerated between 2004 and 2008. The area of sandy surfaces and salt soils, which bear the greatest dust and salt storm generation potential increased by more than 36 {\%}. In parts of the Aralkum desalinization of soils was found to take place within 4--8 years. The implication of the ongoing regression of the Aral Sea is that the expansion of saline surfaces will continue. Knowing the spatio-temporal dynamics of both the location and the surface characteristics of the source areas for dust and salt storms allows drawing conclusions about the potential hazard degree of the dust load. The remote-sensing-based land cover assessment presented in this study could be coupled with existing knowledge on the location of source areas for an early estimation of trends in shifting dust composition. Opportunities, limits, and requirements of satellite-based land cover classification and change detection in the Aralkum are discussed.},

We identified the following activities as relating to the facilitator role: 1) elucidating, that is, matching customer and service provider processes through value propositions; 2) speeding up service processes, by reducing the number of transactions, adjusting resources or processes serving the final customer, facilitating decision-making processes, and prioritizing service tasks; and 3) spreading the word on positive experiences by referencing and giving sales-related support during bidding processes. The conciliator role is important in service recovery and manifests in offering solutions, collecting external resources, collecting and communicating feedback, speeding up communication in general, highlighting realities to the end customer and prioritizing end customers in force majeure situations.

abstract = {In geological imaging spectrometry (i.e., hyperspectral remote sensing), surface compositional information (e.g., mineralogy and subsequently chemistry) is obtained by statistical comparison (by means of spectral matching algorithms) of known field- or library spectra to unknown image spectra. Though these algorithms are readily used, little emphasis has been given to comparison of the performance of the various spectral matching algorithms. Four spectral measures are presented: three that calculate the angle (spectral angle measure, SAM), the vector distance (Euclidean distance measure, ED) or the vector cross-correlation (spectral correlation measure, SCM), between a known reference and unknown target spectrum and a fourth measure that measures the discrepancy of probability distributions between two pixel vectors (the spectral information divergence, SID). The performance of these spectral similarity measures is compared using synthetic hyperspectral and real (i.e., Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, AVIRIS) hyperspectral data of a (artificial or real) hydrothermal alteration system characterised by the minerals alunite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and quartz. Two statistics are used to assess the performance of the spectral similarity measures: the probability of spectral discrimination (PSD) and the power of spectral discrimination (PWSD). The first relates to the ability of the selected set of spectral endmembers to map a target spectrum, whereas the second expresses the capability of a spectral measure to separate two classes relative to a reference class. Analysis of the synthetic data set (i.e., simulated alteration zones with crisp boundaries at 1-2 nm spectral resolution) shows that (1) the SID outperforms the classical empirical spectral matching techniques (SAM, SCM and ED), (2) that SCM (SID, SAM and ED do not) exploits the overall shape of the reflectance curve and hence its outcomes are (positively and negatively) affected by the spectral range selected, (3) SAM and ED give nearly similar results and (4) for the same reason as in (2), the SCM is also more sensitive (again in positive and negative sense) to the spectral noise added. Results from the study of AVIRIS data show that SAM yields more spectral confusion (i.e., class overlap) than SID and SCM. In turn, SID is more effective in mapping the four target minerals than SCM as it clearly outperforms SCM when the target mineral coincides with the mineral phase on the ground. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Remote-sensing phenology detection can compensate for deficiencies in field observations and has the advantage of capturing the continuous expression of phenology on a large scale. However, there is some variability in the results of remote-sensing phenology detection derived from different vegetation parameters in satellite time-series data. Since the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the leaf area index (LAI) are  the most widely used vegetation parameters for remote-sensing phenology extraction, this paper aims to assess the differences in phenological information extracted from EVI and LAI time series and to explore whether either index performs well for all vegetation types on a large scale. To this end, a GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite Product)-LAI-based phenology product (GLP) was generated using the same algorithm as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-EVI phenology product (MLCD) over China from 2001 to 2012. The two phenology products were compared in China for different vegetation types and evaluated using ground observations. The results show that the ratio of missing data is 8.3{\%} for the GLP, which is less than the 22.8{\%} for the MLCD. The differences between the GLP and the MLCD become stronger as the latitude decreases, which also vary among different vegetation types. The start of the growing season (SOS) of the GLP is earlier than that of the MLCD in most vegetation types, and the end of the growing season (EOS) of the GLP is generally later than that of the MLCD. Based on ground observations, it can be suggested that the GLP performs better than the MLCD in evergreen needleleaved forests and croplands, while the MLCD performs better than the GLP in shrublands and grasslands.},

Particularly challenging under the CRPD is the scope, if any, for involuntary treatment. Conventional mental health legislation, such as the Mental Health Act (England and Wales) appears to violate, for example, Article 4 ('no discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability'), Article 12 (persons shall 'enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life') and Article 14 ('the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty').We argue that a form of mental health law, such as the Fusion Law proposal, is consistent with the principles of the CRPD. Such law is aimed at eliminating discrimination against persons with a mental illness. It covers all persons regardless of whether they have a 'mental' or a 'physical' illness, and only allows involuntary treatment when a person's decision-making capability (DMC) for a specific treatment decision is impaired - whatever the health setting or cause of the impairment - and where supported decision making has failed. In addition to impaired DMC, involuntary treatment would require an assessment that such treatment gives the person's values and perspective paramount importance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There is increasing scientific and public concern over the presence of microplastics in the natural environment. We present the results of a systematic review of the literature to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality and more holistic monitoring studies alongside more environmentally realistic effects studies. Only then will we be able to fully characterize risks of microplastics to the environment to support the introduction of regulatory controls that can make a real positive difference to environmental quality.

abstract = {Monitoring and quantifying suspended sediment concentration (SSC) along major fluvial systems such as the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers provide crucial information for biological processes, hydraulic infrastructure, and navigation. Traditional monitoring based on in situ measurements lack the spatial coverage necessary for detailed analysis. This study developed a method for quantifying SSC based on Landsat imagery and corresponding SSC data obtained from United States Geological Survey monitoring stations from 1982 to present. The presented methodology first uses feature fusion based on canonical correlation analysis to extract pertinent spectral information, and then trains a predictive reflectance–SSC model using a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), a cascade forward neural network (CFNN), and an extreme learning machine (ELM). The trained models are then used to predict SSC along the Missouri–Mississippi River system. Results demonstrated that the ELM-based technique generated R2 {\textgreater} 0.9 for Landsat 4–5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 sensors and accurately predicted both relatively high and low SSC displaying little to no overfitting. The ELM model was then applied to Landsat images producing quantitative SSC maps. This study demonstrates the benefit of ELM over traditional modeling methods for the prediction of SSC based on satellite data and its potential to improve sediment transport and monitoring along large fluvial systems.},

This review summarizes the methods and techniques in the extraction from sediment, seawater and organisms, and assesses their advantages and limitations according to different experimental conditions, such as salt solution and reagents added to remove organic matter. Similarly, this overview includes the enumeration methods of microplastics by many kinds of microscopes (e.g. stereomicroscope, fluorescent microscope, scanning electron microscope). Advantages and challenges of using micro-FTIR, ART-FTIR, FPA-FTIR, Pry-GC/MS, and Raman spectroscopy in the identification methods are also discussed.

abstract = {Measuring total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is important in managing heavy polluted urban waters in China. This study uses high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery with four multispectral bands, which roughly correspond to Landsat/TM bands 1–4, to determine TN and TP in small urban rivers and lakes in China. By using Lake Cihu and the lower reaches of Wen-Rui Tang (WRT) River as examples, this paper develops both multiple linear regressions (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models to estimate TN and TP concentrations from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery and in situ water samples collected concurrently with overpassing satellite. The measured and estimated values of both MLR and ANN models are in good agreement $\backslash$r$\backslash$n(R2 {\textgreater} 0.85 and RMSE {\textless} 2.50). The empirical equations selected by MLR are more straightforward, whereas the estimated accuracy using ANN model is better (R2 {\textgreater} 0.86 and RMSE {\textless} 0.89).

Even though their origin and the laws governing their formation have become ever more clear fast and reliable methodologies for their analysis and identification are still lacking or at an early stage of development. The first automatic approaches to analyze $\mu$FTIR images of microplastics which have been enriched on membrane filters are promising and provide the impetus to put further effort into their development. In this paper we present a methodology which allows discrimination between different polymer types and measurement of their abundance and their size distributions with high accuracy. In particular we apply random decision forest classifiers and compute a multiclass model for the polymers polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(methyl methacrylate), polyacrylonitrile and polystyrene. Further classification results of the analyzed $\mu$FTIR images are given for comparability. The study also briefly discusses common issues that can arise in classification such as the curse of dimensionality and label noise.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors and platforms nowadays are being used in almost every application (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and mining) that needs observed information from the top or oblique views. While they intend to be a general remote sensing (RS) tool, the relevant RS data processing and analysis methods are still largely ad-hoc to applications. Although the obvious advantages of UAV data are their high spatial resolution and flexibility in acquisition and sensor integration, there is in general a lack of systematic analysis on how these characteristics alter solutions for typical RS tasks such as land-cover classification, change detection, and thematic mapping. For instance, the ultra-high-resolution data (less than 10 cm of Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)) bring more unwanted classes of objects (e.g., pedestrian and cars) in land-cover classification; the often available 3D data generated from photogrammetric images call for more advanced techniques for geometric and spectral analysis. In this paper, we perform a critical review on RS tasks that involve UAV data and their derived products as their main sources including raw perspective images, digital surface models, and orthophotos. In particular, we focus on solutions that address the “new” aspects of the UAV data including (1) ultra-high resolution; (2) availability of coherent geometric and spectral data; and (3) capability of simultaneously using multi-sensor data for fusion. Based on these solutions, we provide a brief summary of existing examples of UAV-based RS in agricultural, environmental, urban, and hazards assessment applications, etc., and by discussing their practical potentials, we share our views in their future research directions and draw conclusive remarks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The group of cultural remains included charcoal kilns, charcoal pits, hollow-roads, various pits, house foundations, tar kilns, grave mounds and pit-falls. The effects on the interpretation success of different types of cultural remains and their physical properties were studied: size, shape and elevation difference showing that the detection success rates varied considerably. The main tendency was that large cultural remains with clear geometrical shape (ovals and circles) and large elevation difference were much more successfully detected and classified compared to the smaller ones, especially those without a clear geometrical shape. The study also showed that it was the identification of the larger structures which profited most from an increased resolution of the DTM, and it was of no help to increase resolution in order to improve the identification of the irregularly shaped cultural remains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The investigation was carried out for the archaeological area of Monte Irsi (Southern Italy) characterized by dense herbaceous cover and complex topographical and morphological features, which make air/space prospection very difficult.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Forest structure is a crucial component in the assessment of whether a forest is likely to act as a carbon sink under changing climate. Detailed 3D structural information about the tundra–taiga ecotone of Siberia is mostly missing and still underrepresented in current research due to the remoteness and restricted accessibility. Field based, high-resolution remote sensing can provide important knowledge for the understanding of vegetation properties and dynamics. In this study, we test the applicability of consumer-grade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for rapid calculation of stand metrics in treeline forests. We reconstructed high-resolution photogrammetric point clouds and derived canopy height models for 10 study sites from NE Chukotka and SW Yakutia. Subsequently, we detected individual tree tops using a variable-window size local maximum filter and applied a marker-controlled watershed segmentation for the delineation of tree crowns. With this, we successfully detected 67.1{\%} of the validation individuals. Simple linear regressions of observed and detected metrics show a better correlation (R2) and lower relative root mean square percentage error (RMSE{\%}) for tree heights (mean R2 = 0.77, mean RMSE{\%} = 18.46{\%}) than for crown diameters (mean R2 = 0.46, mean RMSE{\%} = 24.9{\%}). The comparison between detected and observed tree height distributions revealed that our tree detection method was unable to representatively identify trees {\textless}2 m. Our results show that plot sizes for vegetation surveys in the tundra–taiga ecotone should be adapted to the forest structure and have a radius of {\textgreater}15–20 m to capture homogeneous and representative forest stands. Additionally, we identify sources of omission and commission errors and give recommendations for their mitigation. In summary, the efficiency of the used method depends on the complexity of the forest's stand structure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

First, this approach obtains normalized non-ground UAV points in data preprocessing; then, a voxel-based mean shift algorithm is used to roughly classify the non-ground UAV points into well-detected and under-segmentation clusters. Moreover, potential tree apices for each under-segmentation cluster are obtained with regard to profile shape curves and finally input to the normalized cut segmentation (NCut) algorithm to segment iteratively the under-segmentation cluster into single trees. We evaluated the proposed method using datasets acquired by a Velodyne 16E LiDAR system mounted on a multi-rotor UAV. The results showed that the proposed method achieves the average correctness, completeness, and overall accuracy of 0.90, 0.88, and 0.89, respectively, in delineating single trees.

Reservoir thermal stratification drives the water temperature and dissolved oxygen gradient, however, the characteristic of vertical water microbial community during thermal stratification is so far poorly understood. In this work, water bacterial community diversity was determined using the Illumina Miseq sequencing technique. The results showed that epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion were formed steadily in the JINPEN drinking water reservoir. Water temperature decreased steadily from the surface (23.11 °C) to the bottom (9.17 °C). Total nitrogen ranged from 1.07 to 2.06 mg/L and nitrate nitrogen ranged from 0.8 to 1.84 mg/L. The dissolved oxygen concentration decreased sharply below 50 m, and reached zero at 65 m. The Miseq sequencing revealed a total of 4127 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97{\%} similarity, which were affiliated with 15 phyla including Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Caldiserica, Chlamydiae, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia.

Prosthecobacter dominated from 0.5 to 50 m. The heat map profile and redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated significant difference in vertical water bacterial community composition in the reservoir. Meanwhile, water quality properties including dissolved oxygen, conductivity, nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen have a dramatic influence on vertical distribution of bacterial communities.},

Results show that total demand in the region will increase to 393 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2050, while total water shortage will grow to 199 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in 2050 for the average climate change projection, an increase of 157 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This increase in shortage is the combined impact of an increase in water demand by 50{\%} with a decrease in water supply by 12{\%}. Uncertainty, based on the output of the nine GCMs applied, reveals that expected water shortage ranges from 85 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 283 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\~{}}in 2050. The analysis shows that 22{\%} of the water shortage can be attributed to climate change and 78{\%} to changes in socio-economic factors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This essay deals with the role of postcolonial cinema in articulating and visualizing issues of migration, uprooting and alienation, with specific relation to Europe and the Southern Mediterranean shore. Cinema as a transnational medium is particularly suitable for conveying denunciation and social critique. Yet this must be combined with an understanding of how the different cinematic traditions and genres contribute, in specific aesthetic and ethical ways, towards conveying the message and impact on the audiences. The scope of this essay is to theorize migration in the context of postcolonial cinema and to discuss the space occupied by the documentary (genre/form) within the framework of postcolonial cinema that deals with migration. This will be done through the close reading of two migrant films produced in Spain and Italy, respectively: 14 Kil{\'{o}}metros (2007) and A Sud di Lampedusa (2006), both of which are concerned with the question of border crossing and African migrants' attempts to reach the southern shore of Europe, following very different visual registers. This raises questions about the political and cultural contextualization of migration to Europe from Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, in which the Mediterranean assumes a new protagonist role that reconfigures our ideas about the porosity of Europe and the liquidity of cinema.},

The lactobacilli species L. brevis, L. diolivorans, L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus could be differentiated on the basis of their FTIR spectra by applying multivariate statistical techniques (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling). The strains belonging to L. paracasei and L. casei could not be separated from each other, and formed one group that was distanced from the other investigated species. The combination of common multivariate statistical methods used for the analysis of FTIR spectra could provide a powerful method for discrimination and even the identification of lactobacilli on a species level. The strains and subspecies within the lactobacilli species could not be differentiated by applying multivariate exploratory statistical methods. The FTIR spectra of lactobacilli were robust against the variation in the consistency of the growth medium (broth or agar medium of the same composition), applied spectroscopic techniques (KRS-5 or tablets) and the recorded biomass quantities of 2 and 3 mg. Furthermore, the distances between the two spectra of the same selected strain, which were sampled ca. 12 months apart, were insignificant. ? 2008 INRA EDP Sciences.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the efficiency of Water User Associations (WUA) in the Zeuss- Koutine region (Tunisia) and studies its main determinants. First, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to assess the overall WUA efficiency and to evaluate the management and engineering sub-vector efficiencies separately through a mathematical modification of the initial DEA model. In a second step critical determinants of sub-vector efficiency are determined using a Tobit model. A major finding of the study is that WUAs are clearly inefficient. Under variable returns to scale (VRS) specification, the average technical efficiency of WUA was 84.4{\%}. This implies that output level could be produced by saving 15.6{\%} of (all) used inputs. The average scale efficiency was around 96.5{\%}, indicating that many WUAs are not operating at an efficient scale. Results show also that inefficiencies of the management and maintenance are higher than the overall inefficiency. The average management efficiency is around 80.6{\%} while the average engineering efficiency is 82.3{\%} indicating that about 19{\%} of management and maintenance expenditures could be saved if WUAs were operated in a sound manner. The inefficiency found can be mainly attributed to the number of water pumping stations managed and the number of years of experience operating a WUA (age).},

It largely builds on existing knowledge and understanding and aims to present a review of existing information on this topic. The region is particularly challenged by a number of factors, including the large variability of bio-geographical characteristics, extreme population growth over the last few decades, and substantial societal and economical transitions, as well as armed conflicts in some of the countries in the region. Anticipated changes in climate conditions will exacerbate the challenges regarding water and energy security in the region. Major impacts of climate change include a significant increase in summer temperatures, which will lead to a growing number of heat waves, primarily in urban structures. A general decrease in precipitation in many of the MENA countries is foreseen, resulting in enhanced droughts and a growing number of dry spells. In addressing energy and water scarcities and their mutual interrelationships, an integrated water{\&}ndash;energy nexus concept offers promising prospects to improve environmental, climate, human, and political security. However, only very few countries in the MENA region have presently implemented such a concept. Mitigation and adaptation strategies addressing water and energy scarcity include enhanced efficiency of resource use, integrated technology assessments regarding electricity generation, and a stronger reliance on renewable/solar technologies. While looking at the MENA region as a whole, some emphasis will be given to Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean.},

As a consequence the land use activities in urban and suburban areas are changing dramatically. To provide cost-effective information about the current state and how it is changing in order to develop integrated policies, multi-temporal remotely sensed data, with its synoptic and regular coverage, is being used. Nevertheless, the mapping and monitoring of urban change through remote sensing is difficult owing to the complex urban land use patterns. Although many image processing techniques have been developed for this purpose, they are complicated by differences amongst images caused by differences in the effects of the atmosphere, illumination, and surface moisture. One technique which is relatively unaffected by these problems is based on artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms. The main objective of this study was to examine the performance of two ANN classifiers for land use classification using Landsat TM data. Two different supervised ANN approaches were used: the multi layer perceptron (MLP) and the learning vector quantization (LVQ). The performance of these classifiers was compared to the more conventional maximum likelihood approach.},

abstract = {Agricultural land abandonment is a common land-use change, making the accurate mapping of both location and timing when agricultural land abandonment occurred important to understand its environmental and social outcomes. However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi-resolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 ± 1{\%}), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 ± 3{\%}). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.},

abstract = {Over the past years Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a prospective tool for cancer diagnostics. In order to apply FTIR spectroscopy as a routine tool for biomedical diagnostics of tissue samples, strong and reliable classifiers are needed. Frequently, the number of available tissue samples is restricted and due to that data sets consist of a small number of samples, often less than 100. This can result in unstable classifiers, which perform poorly on unseen data. In this work we present a way to overcome this limitation by aggregating several support vector machines in to an ensemble. Different ensemble systems, including bagging, boosting and tree-based models, were investigated for a FTIR data set acquired from different types and stages of breast cancer. It was found that an ensemble system predicts 88.9{\%} of the unseen multi-class test set correctly. In comparison a single classifier only achieved a predictive performance of 66.7{\%}. As these results show, the application of SVM ensembles in biomedical diagnostics using FTIR spectroscopy can be highly beneficial. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The main purpose of this study was to model the link between wetland biomass conditions in the Ili River delta and changes in the Balkhash Lake water level. A monthly, coarse-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset was used as an indicator of vegetation activity and biomass dynamics in the Ili River delta wetland for the period between 1982 and 2003. The NDVI displays significant intra-annual and interannual variability strongly correlated with Ili River discharge and Balkhash Lake water level.

Spatial pattern of land use change and its driving forces were investigated in China in the early 21st century. To sum up, land use change pattern of this period was characterized by rapid changes in the whole country. Over the agricultural zones, e.g., Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, the southeast coastal areas and Sichuan Basin, a great proportion of fine arable land were engrossed owing to considerable expansion of the built-up and residential areas, resulting in decrease of paddy land area in southern China. The development of oasis agriculture in Northwest China and the reclamation in Northeast China led to a slight increase in arable land area in northern China. Due to the ``Grain for Green'' policy, forest area was significantly increased in the middle and western developing regions, where the vegetation coverage was substantially enlarged, likewise. This paper argued the main driving forces as the implementation of the strategy on land use and regional development, such as policies of ``Western Development'', ``Revitalization of Northeast'', coupled with rapidly economic development during this period.},

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been used as a powerful tool for food quality assessment. However, the near-infrared (NIR) spectra comprise a large number of redundant information. Determining wavelengths relevance and selecting subsets for classification and prediction models are mandatory for the development of multispectral systems. A combination of both attribute and wavelength selection for NIR spectral information of chicken meat samples was investigated. Decision Trees and Decision Table predictors exploit these optimal wavelengths for classification tasks according to different quality grades of poultry meat. The proposed methodology was conducted with a support vector machine algorithm (SVM) to compare the precision of the proposed model. Experiments were performed on NIR spectral information (1050 wavelengths), colour (CIE     L   ∗     a   ∗     b   ∗     , chroma, and hue), water holding capacity (WHC), and pH of each sample analyzed. Results show that the best method was the REPTree based on 12 wavelengths, allowing for classification of poultry samples according to quality grades with   77.2 {\%}   precision.

abstract = { AbstractThe Aral Sea is a huge terminal lake located among the deserts of Central Asia. Over the past 10 millennia, it has repeatedly filled and dried, owing both to natural and human forces. The most recent desiccation started in the early 1960s and owes overwhelmingly to the expansion of irrigation that has drained its two tributary rivers. Lake level has fallen 23 m, area shrunk 74{\%}, volume decreased 90{\%}, and salinity grew from 10 to more than 100g/l, causing negative ecological changes, including decimation of native fish species, initiation of dust/salt storms, degradation of deltaic biotic communities, and climate change around the former shoreline. The population residing around the lake has also been negatively impacted. There is little hope in the foreseeable future to fully restore the Aral Sea, but measures to preserve/rehabilitate parts of the water body and the deltas are feasible. },

abstract = {This paper quantifies and analyses the water footprint of Tunisia at national and sub-national level, assessing green, blue and grey water footprints for the period 1996-2005. It also assesses economic water and land productivities related to crop production for irrigated and rain-fed agriculture, and water scarcity. The water footprint of crop production gave the largest contribution (87{\%}) to the total national water footprint. At national level, tomatoes and potatoes were the main crops with relatively high economic water productivity, while olives and barley were the main crops with relatively low productivity. In terms of economic land productivity, oranges had the highest productivity and barley the lowest. South Tunisia had the lowest economic water and land productivities. Economic land productivity was found to explain more of the current production patterns than economic water productivity, which may imply opportunities for water saving. The total blue water footprint of crop production represented 31{\%} of the total renewable blue water resources, which means that Tunisia as a whole experienced significant water scarcity. The blue water footprint on groundwater represented 62{\%} of the total renewable groundwater resources, which means that the country faced severe water scarcity related to groundwater.},

The thematic maps derived from remotely-sensed images are invaluable sources of information for various investigations since they provide spatial and temporal information about the nature of Earth surface materials and objects. The robustness of classification techniques used to produce these thematic maps can be crucial especially for complex classification problems. This study aims to determine the level of contributions of multi-temporal and multi-sensor data together with their principal components for Maximum Likelihood and Artificial Neural Network classifiers. The performance of a multi-layer perceptron that learns the characteristics of the data using backpropagation algorithm is compared to that of Maximum Likelihood classifier in identifying major land cover classes present in the study area, Beykoz district of Istanbul, Turkey. The image data available for the study are from Landsat ETM+ and Terra ASTER images. Image band combinations are inputted to the neural network for training and the success of the classification is tested using test data sets. Results show that the neural network approach is an attractive and effective way of extracting land cover information using multi-spectral, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images. It is also observed that the level of contribution of principal components to the results is much less than the contribution of multi-temporal data in terms of the classification accuracy.},

Recently, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been expected to be an easy-to-use, cost-effective tool for remote sensing of forests, and deep learning has attracted attention for its ability concerning machine vision. In this study, using a commercially available UAV and a publicly available package for deep learning, we constructed a machine vision system for the automatic classification of trees. In our method, we segmented a UAV photography image of forest into individual tree crowns and carried out object-based deep learning. As a result, the system was able to classify 7 tree types at 89.0{\%} accuracy. This performance is notable because we only used basic RGB images from a standard UAV. In contrast, most of previous studies used expensive hardware such as multispectral imagers to improve the performance. This result means that our method has the potential to classify individual trees in a cost-effective manner. This can be a usable tool for many forest researchers and managements.},

The analysis of microplastic samples by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a versatile, bias-free tool to succeed at this task. In this study, we provide an adaptable reference database, which can be applied to single-particle identification as well as methods like chemical imaging based on FTIR microscopy. The large datasets generated by chemical imaging can be further investigated by automated analysis, which does, however, require a carefully designed database. The novel database design is based on the hierarchical cluster analysis of reference spectra in the spectral range from 3600 to 1250 cm−1. The hereby generated database entries were optimized for the automated analysis software with defined reference datasets. The design was further tested for its customizability with additional entries. The final reference database was extensively tested on reference datasets and environmental samples. Data quality by means of correct particle identification and depiction significantly increased compared to that of previous databases, proving the applicability of the concept and highlighting the importance of this work. Our novel database provides a reference point for data comparison with future and previous microplastic studies that are based on different databases. Graphical abstract ᅟ ￼},

The data were compressed and further processed statistically using multivariate chemometric techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster Analysis (CA), Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA). Specifically, unsupervised PCA framed the importance of the variety of carobs, while supervised analysis highlighted the contribution of the geographical origin. Best classification models were achieved with PLS regression on first derivative spectra, giving an overall correct classification. Thus, the applied methodology enabled the differentiation of carobs flesh and seed per their origin.

abstract = {The presence of microplastics in the marine environment poses a great threat to the entire ecosystem and has received much attention lately as the presence has greatly impacted oceans, lakes, seas, rivers, coastal areas and even the Polar Regions. Microplastics are found in most commonly utilized products (primary microplastics), or may originate from the fragmentation of larger plastic debris (secondary microplastics). The material enters the marine environment through terrestrial and land-based activities, especially via runoffs and is known to have great impact on marine organisms as studies have shown that large numbers of marine organisms have been affected by microplastics. Microplastic particles have been found distributed in large numbers in Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and in Europe. This review describes the sources and global distribution of microplastics in the environment, the fate and impact on marine biota, especially the food chain. Furthermore, the control measures discussed are those mapped out by both national and international environmental organizations for combating the impact from microplastics. Identifying the main sources of microplastic pollution in the environment and creating awareness through education at the public, private, and government sectors will go a long way in reducing the entry of microplastics into the environment. Also, knowing the associated behavioral mechanisms will enable better understanding of the impacts for the marine environment. However, a more promising and environmentally safe approach could be provided by exploiting the potentials of microorganisms, especially those of marine origin that can degrade microplastics. Capsule The concentration, distribution sources and fate of microplastics in the global marine environment were discussed, so also was the impact of microplastics on a wide range of marine biota.},

abstract = {Soil biodiversity plays a key role in regulating the processes that underpin the delivery of ecosystem goods and services in terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural intensification is known to change the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, but less is known about how intensification affects biodiversity of the soil food web as a whole, and whether or not these effects may be generalized across regions. We examined biodiversity in soil food webs from grasslands, extensive, and intensive rotations in four agricultural regions across Europe: in Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic and Greece. Effects of land-use intensity were quantified based on structure and diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as well as on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. We also elucidate land-use intensity effects on diversity of taxonomic units within taxonomic groups of soil fauna. We found that between regions soil food web diversity measures were variable, but that increasing land-use intensity caused highly consistent responses. In particular, land-use intensification reduced the complexity in the soil food webs, as well as the community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. In all regions across Europe, species richness of earthworms, Collembolans, and oribatid mites was negatively affected by increased land-use intensity. The taxonomic distinctness, which is a measure of taxonomic relatedness of species in a community that is independent of species richness, was also reduced by land-use intensification. We conclude that intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity, making soil food webs less diverse and composed of smaller bodied organisms. Land-use intensification results in fewer functional groups of soil biota with fewer and taxonomically more closely related species. We discuss how these changes in soil biodiversity due to land-use intensification may threaten the functioning of soil in agricultural production systems.},

abstract = {Aims Grasslands are the world's most extensive terrestrial ecosystem, and are a major feed source for livestock. Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and groundbased sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development. Important Findings The retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation.},

abstract = {A method for the identification and quantification of microplastics in table sea salts. The method meets the need for detecting and automatic counting microplastics simultaneously. Microplastics have been one of the most serious environmental pollutants of concern over recent decades. These pollutants have been detected not only in the marine biota, but also in abiotic sea products such as sea salts, which might pose a threat to food safety. Although efficient methods for the analysis of microplastics in different matrices have been published, in many cases, part of the quantification protocol relies on counting by eye, which is inefficient and time consuming. In this study, a new method for the analysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics in table sea salts was developed. After hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) pretreatment and filtration, the PET particles in vacuum-filtered retentates of table sea salts were imaged by micro-FT-NIR imaging and identified using spectral similarity methods including correlation coefficient mapping (CCM), spectral angle mapping (SAM) and Euclidean distance mapping (EDM) methods. The number of particles was acquired by a computer based automatic counting method. The results showed that, in most cases, the number of microplastics obtained by the automatic counting method was equal to that obtained by the counting by eye method, which proved that micro-NIR chemical imaging combined with chemometric methods can be an alternative way to identify and count the microplastics simultaneously. This method for detecting and quantifying PET microplastics in table sea salts could also be applied to other types of polymers in other environmental sample detection. },

It is therefore critical to develop strategies targeted at the root causes of these problems. However, to do so would require a rapid and reliable information system that has been elusive because of the complexity of the environment and the limitations of the existing tools.

We investigated current cotton growing patterns in Khorezm, one representative cotton production region in Uzbekistan utilizing time series of 250-m MODIS satellite data. A Random Forest model was established using reference data of 2004-2007 to generate annual crop maps in 2000-2009. A linear model was applied to assess the spatial distribution of the longest observed cotton sequence within the ten-year observation period. All cotton-growing sequences were compared to the national crop rotation recommendations. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82{\%}. We found that cotton remains the major crop in the region. It was cultivated for more than five out of the ten years on 46.5{\%} of the cropland. But "Soviet cropping conditions" on less than 20{\%} and officially recommended cotton sequences on more than 50{\%} of the cropland challenge the notion that cotton mono-crop dominates Central Asia. Statistical analysis revealed that long cotton sequences preferably occur on fields far from settlements and under reduced soil suitability for irrigation. The results enable decision makers to better explain unfavourable cotton cultivation practices and to stimulate improvements.},

abstract = {The future climate is projected to change rapidly with potentially severe consequences for global food security. This study aims to improve the understanding of future changes in the suitability of crop growth conditions. It proposes a definition of crop realization, of the climate departure from recent historical variability, or crop–climate departure. Four statistically downscaled and bias-corrected Global Climate Models (GCMs): CCCMA, CNRM5, NOAA-GFDL, and MIROC5 performed simulations for the period 1960–2100 under the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5 scenario to compute 20 year moving averages at 5-year increments. These were used to drive a crop suitability model, Ecocrop, for eight different crops across the three Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) AgroEcological Zones (AEZs) of West Africa (Guinea, Sahel, and Savanna). Simulations using historical climate data found that all crops except maize had a suitability index value (SIV) ≥0.50 outside the Sahel region, equivalent to conditions being suitable or strongly suitable. Simulations of future climate reveal that warming is projected to constrain crop growth suitability for cassava and pineapple in the Guinea zone. A potential for the northward expansion of maize is projected by the end of the century, suggesting a future opportunity for its growth in the southern Sahel zone. Crop growth conditions for mango and pearl millet remain suitable across all three AEZs. In general, crops in the Savanna AEZ are the most sensitive to the projected changes in climate. The changes in the crop–climate relationship suggests a future constraint in crop suitability, which could be detrimental to future food security in West Africa. Further studies to explore associated short- and long-term adaptation options are recommended.},

In addition to the exploration of their presence in fishes, researchers are studying the presence of microplastics in coastal areas. The workload is therefore time consuming, due to the need to carry out regular campaigns to quantify their presence in the samples. So, in this work a method for automatic counting and classifying microplastic particles is presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to address this challenging problem. The method makes use of Computer Vision techniques for analyzing the acquired images of the samples; and Machine Learning techniques to develop accurate classifiers of the different types of microplastic particles that are considered.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors and platforms nowadays are being used in almost every application (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and mining) that needs observed information from the top or oblique views. While they intend to be a general remote sensing (RS) tool, the relevant RS data processing and analysis methods are still largely ad-hoc to applications. Although the obvious advantages of UAV data are their high spatial resolution and flexibility in acquisition and sensor integration, there is in general a lack of systematic analysis on how these characteristics alter solutions for typical RS tasks such as land-cover classification, change detection, and thematic mapping. For instance, the ultra-high-resolution data (less than 10 cm of Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)) bring more unwanted classes of objects (e.g., pedestrian and cars) in land-cover classification; the often available 3D data generated from photogrammetric images call for more advanced techniques for geometric and spectral analysis. In this paper, we perform a critical review on RS tasks that involve UAV data and their derived products as their main sources including raw perspective images, digital surface models, and orthophotos. In particular, we focus on solutions that address the “new” aspects of the UAV data including (1) ultra-high resolution; (2) availability of coherent geometric and spectral data; and (3) capability of simultaneously using multi-sensor data for fusion. Based on these solutions, we provide a brief summary of existing examples of UAV-based RS in agricultural, environmental, urban, and hazards assessment applications, etc., and by discussing their practical potentials, we share our views in their future research directions and draw conclusive remarks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Reconstruction of prehistoric and historic road and path networks in forested areas through the application of Airborne Laser Scanning. For this project we formulated two main aims. The first one, and most important, is the development of methodology for the use of Airborne Laser Scan (ALS) data for historical road networks research. The second one is the reconstruction of road networks in two case study areas. The reason to work with two case studies is that the methodology should be applicable in forested areas of different landscapes. In other words, it should not depend on specific morphology, vegetation or regional road and path type. Therefore the ALS data of one research area will serve to develop the methodology and the second to prove the validity of its application in a different landscape. The first research area is the Leitha Hills, about 40 kilometers southeast of Vienna. It is an area of 190 km2 of mixed trees, mainly oak and beech, on a limestone soil. The highest point is 484 meters above sea level. The difference in altitude between this peak and the lowest point at the foot of the hills is about 250 meters. The ALS data from the Leitha area will be used to develop the methodology. The second area is the Veluwe area. It is a mainly forested area in the center of the Netherlands on a push moraine with sandy soils and extends over an area of about 1000 km2. The forest is a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees. The highest point here is 110 meters above sea level; the lowest point is almost at sea level. Both study areas have a time depth from the Neolithic till now. Before discussing the methodology and the first results, I would like to address the issue of why we think it is worthwhile to investigate historical roads and paths. Historical roads and maps can provide important insights about the landscape and its use in the past both on local and regional scales. If we compare, for example, roads and paths on historical maps of different periods, it becomes clear that road patterns have changed over a relative short period as have the uses related to them. 2 This should make us aware that landscape could be quite dynamic in historic periods and probably even in prehistoric times. The same accounts for the effect of erosion and other natural decay processes in the landscape on archaeological features. 3 These two facts should make us cautious when we draw conclusions about landscape in the past based on the features that are still visible or detectable. 4 Despite the importance of roads and paths for getting insights of historical},

abstract = {Fisheries in arid countries of Central Asia and in Kazakhstan have a relatively short tradition of less than 100 years. However during this period, water resources, originating largely from snow and ice melt, have been subject to large-scale engineering interference required by the growing demands for the expansion of irrigated agriculture. Storage and diversion of flow into irrigation systems have affected original fish stocks through change, in river discharges, blockage of migratory pathways by dams and barrages, increase in dissolved salt content and agrochemicals in drainage waters. In order to boost the indigenous fish stocks, which often give poor yields, fishery managers transferred a number of fish species from other parts of Asia within the ex-Soviet Union. In order to improve the food base for such fish, fish food organisms such as mysids, gammarids and molluscs were also transferred. The introductions often increased fish yields only temporarily or interfered with the indigenous stocks. In addition to valuable fish species, unwanted fish were sometimes brought in. Where river basins became interconnected through canals, fish faunas of these basins intermingled through immigration of species. The new fish communities now form a mixture of indigenous and introduced fish, where one can rarely assume that a balanced state has been achieved. The priority of the governments remains the use of water for irrigation and hydropower production, which leaves fishery managers in the unenviable position of adjusting the management to the continuously changing situation, which is often unpredictable. In order to increase fish production present government strategies focus on the rehabilitation of rivers and terminal lakes with the aim of arresting and reversing the process of salinization of waters and of maintaining water level in lakes. This allows fishery managers to develop strategies for optimizing fish yields under more stable conditions. With the new efforts to revitalize the Aral Sea, the large artificial terminal lakes established from drainage and wash waters, will become of minor importance for fisheries, as their salinity will increase beyond the tolerance level of most fish. However, in fresh-water reservoirs and lakes, including those formed from seepage in depressions near irrigation canals, there is considerable potential for raising fish yields. Culture-enhanced methodologies, when introduced, should also lead to substantial increases in fish production from these water bodies.},

abstract = {Abstract The Plio-Quaternary aquifer of Chtouka is located in Southwestern of Morocco. The intensive agricultural activity in Chtouka basin requires the mobilization of 94{\%} of fresh water resources for irrigation. This overexploitation, along with the succession of drought years, sea water intrusion and various sources of pollution, affected the quality and availability of groundwater resources. Several sampling campaigns were carried out in different sites of the study area in order to investigate the spatial variation of groundwater quality. The temporal evolution of groundwater level shows that the water table was subjected to a gradual decline during the last decade, indicating an intensive exploitation mainly in irrigated areas. In the Southern part around Belfaa and the irrigated area along Massa River, nitrate concentrations exceed 50mg/L, which is the threshold set by the World Health Organization, while in the northern part around Biougra and Ait Amira, the nitrate concentration is mostly below 50mg/L indicating a relative good groundwater quality. This finding can be explained by the improvement of agricultural practices, particularly the conversion of flood and sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation (80{\%} of the total irrigated area) in most of the developed farms in this part of the study area. Moreover, the exploitation of groundwater from the deep aquifer, due to the increasing water demand in the region, can also explain the low chemical concentrations since the deep aquifer is not affected by anthropogenic pollutants or marine intrusion. Stable isotopes (18O and 2H) highlight the different origins of groundwater, indicating the complexity of the aquifer system path flows, which is attributable to the intensive exploitation and irrigation water return.},

The feasibility of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was investigated for detecting 15-AcDON in crude and refined corn oils. Corn oils contaminated artificially with 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON) and Fusarium asiaticum (defined as "Fusarium-contaminated corn oil") and only with 15-AcDON (defined as "Fusarium-free corn oil") were tested to simulate 15-AcDON contamination in crude oil and in refined oil, respectively. The contaminations with 15-AcDON at different levels were discriminated by a PCA score plot for both contaminated corn oils. The specific IR bands of 15-AcDON were revealed for each oil, which could be assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of the ester (O)C-O. By comparison between the spectra of both oils, no interference of the F. asiaticum in the detection of 15-AcDON was found, however, the difference of the specific band region for 15-AcDON between both oils was observed. The results suggested that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy could be a promising method for rapid screening of 15-AcDON in crude and refined corn oils.},

A global, yet spatially disaggregated, green-blue analysis of water availability and requirement, using the LPJmL dynamic vegetation and water balance model, indicates that many countries currently assessed as severely water short are able to produce enough food for their populations if green water is considered and is managed well. The need to integrate green and blue water management is highlighted in a future scenario of water availability under climate change and population growth (HadCM2 A2). For 2050, the scenario indicates that 59{\%} of the world population will face blue water shortage, and 36{\%} will face green and blue water shortage. Even under climate change, good options to build water resilience exist without further expansion of cropland, particularly through management of local green water resources that reduces risks for dry spells and agricultural droughts.},

The relationship between water quality variables - permanganate index (COD(Mn)), ammonia-nitrogen (NH(3)-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) - and spectral components of SPOT-5 data for the Weihe River in China was constructed by the proposed method. Spatial distribution maps for the three water quality variables were also developed.

abstract = {The continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment. Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters. Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles. In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330 $\mu$m for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk.},

abstract = {Microplastics ({\textless}5 mm) have been documented in environmental samples on a global scale. While these pollutants may enter aquatic environments via wastewater treatment facilities, the abundance of microplastics in these matrices has not been investigated. Although efficient methods for the analysis of microplastics in sediment samples and marine organisms have been published, no methods have been developed for detecting these pollutants within organic-rich wastewater samples. In addition, there is no standardized method for analyzing microplastics isolated from environmental samples. In many cases, part of the identification protocol relies on visual selection before analysis, which is open to bias. In order to address this, a new method for the analysis of microplastics in wastewater was developed. A pretreatment step using 30{\%} hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was employed to remove biogenic material, and focal plane array (FPA)- based reflectance micro-Fourier-transform (FT-IR) imaging was shown to successfully image and identify different microplastic types (polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon-6, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene). Microplastic-spiked wastewater samples were used to validate the methodology, resulting in a robust protocol which was nonselective and reproducible (the overall success identification rate was 98.33{\%}). The use of FPA-based micro-FT-IR spectroscopy also provides a considerable reduction in analysis time compared with previous methods, since samples that could take several days to be mapped using a single-element detector can now be imaged in less than 9 h (circular filter with a diameter of 47 mm). This method for identifying and quantifying microplastics in wastewater is likely to provide an essential tool for further research into the pathways by which microplastics enter the environment.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the long-term trends and variations of temperature and precipitation on annual timescale in the Ili-Balkhash Basin (IBB), Kazakhstan. Some statistical tools were employed to detect any climate variations at four stations in the IBB during the period between 1936 and 2005. These methods included the Mann-Kendall trend test, the Theil-Sen approach, and the sequential Mann-Kendall test. The results showed that in temporal scale, the climate in the IBB has been becoming warmer and wetter in the past several decades as a whole. The annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation in the IBB showed an increasing trend since the 1970s and the 1940s, respectively. The significance of the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation trends in the IBB was tested at {\textgreater}95 {\%} confidence level. The slope of the increasing trend of annual mean temperature ranges from 0.019 to 0.029 °C/year, and that of the annual precipitation ranges from 0.654 to 2.179 mm/year. In spatial scale, the multiyear mean values of temperature and precipitation are greater in the southern mountain region than those in the northern plain and hilly land area of the basin. The multiyear mean temperature decreases with the increasing latitudes, while increases with the increasing altitudes except for Karaganda; the multiyear mean precipitation increase with the increasing altitudes, while decreases centered with the Lake Balkhash from the surrounding area. The results may provide climatic backgrounds for solving the problems related to water sources of the IBB. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This review of 68 studies compares the methodologies used for the identification and quantification of microplastics from the marine environment. Three main sampling strategies were identified: selective, volume-reduced, and bulk sampling. Most sediment samples came from sandy beaches at the high tide line, and most seawater samples were taken at the sea surface using neuston nets. Four steps were distinguished during sample processing: density separation, filtration, sieving, and visual sorting of microplastics. Visual sorting was one of the most commonly used methods for the identification of microplastics (using type, shape, degradation stage, and color as criteria). Chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., specific density) were also used. The most reliable method to identify the chemical composition of microplastics is by infrared spectroscopy. Most studies reported that plastic fragments were polyethylene and polypropylene polymers. Units commonly used for abundance estimates are "items per m(2)" for sediment and sea surface studies and "items per m(3)" for water column studies. Mesh size of sieves and filters used during sampling or sample processing influence abundance estimates. Most studies reported two main size ranges of microplastics: (i) 500 $\mu$m-5 mm, which are retained by a 500 $\mu$m sieve/net, and (ii) 1-500 $\mu$m, or fractions thereof that are retained on filters. We recommend that future programs of monitoring continue to distinguish these size fractions, but we suggest standardized sampling procedures which allow the spatiotemporal comparison of microplastic abundance across marine environments.},

abstract = { Identification of chicken quality parameters is often inconsistent, time-consuming, and laborious. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been used as a powerful tool for food quality assessment. However, the near-infrared (NIR) spectra comprise a large number of redundant information. Determining wavelengths relevance and selecting subsets for classification and prediction models are mandatory for the development of multispectral systems. A combination of both attribute and wavelength selection for NIR spectral information of chicken meat samples was investigated. Decision Trees and Decision Table predictors exploit these optimal wavelengths for classification tasks according to different quality grades of poultry meat. The proposed methodology was conducted with a support vector machine algorithm (SVM) to compare the precision of the proposed model. Experiments were performed on NIR spectral information (1050 wavelengths), colour (CIE     L   ∗     a   ∗     b   ∗     , chroma, and hue), water holding capacity (WHC), and pH of each sample analyzed. Results show that the best method was the REPTree based on 12 wavelengths, allowing for classification of poultry samples according to quality grades with   77.2 {\%}   precision. The selected wavelengths could lead to potential simple multispectral acquisition devices. },

While hyperspectral instruments can record hundreds of contiguous narrow bands, much of the data are redundant and/or provide no increase in utility for distinguishing objects. Knowledge of the optimal bands allows users to efficiently focus on bands that provide the most information and several data reduction tools are available. The objective of this Communication was to evaluate Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for identifying optimal bands to discriminate wetland plant species. In-situ hyperspectral reflectance measurements were obtained for thirty-five species in two diverse Great Lakes wetlands. PCA was executed on a suite of categories based on botanical plant/substrate characteristics and spectral configuration schemes. Results showed that the data dependency of PCA makes it a poor, stand alone tool for selecting optimal wavelengths. PCA does not allow diagnostic comparison across sites and wavelengths identified by PCA do not necessarily represent wavelengths that indicate biophysical attributes of interest. Further, narrow bands captured by hyperspectral sensors need to be substantially resampled and/or smoothed in order for PCA to identify useful information. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {This paper estimates farmers' individual irrigation water demand functions employing the information hidden in individual farmers' technical efficiency. This information is extracted through the development of a new deductive methodology based on inverse Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models. The empirical results for Tunisia show that farmers who are more technically efficient have less elastic irrigation water demand functions; these farmers would adjust demand only to a limited extent and they can afford the water price. In contrast, water pricing significantly affects those that are less efficient. These farmers shift towards a different cropping pattern using significantly less water and more land when the price of water increases. Thus, higher water prices would threaten this category's livelihood if their efficiency is not improved. However, if the technical efficiency of these farmers were to improve, then it would be more difficult to reach water saving objectives since their demand will also become highly inelastic. The findings have important implications in view of the objectives of Tunisia water policy which include:full cost recovery, continuity of the irrigation activity, and water saving at the national level. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Besides low resolution sensors as SPOT-VGT and NOAA-AVHRR, medium resolution data from TERRA/AQUA-MODIS or ENVISAT-MERIS are used at pan-European level. In case of available time series, esp. NOAA-AVHRR (since 1981) and SPOT-VGT (since 1998) difference values of the indicators (e.g. relative or absolute differences) and frequency analysis of the indicators (e.g. position in historical range or distribution) are calculated. The exploitation of the data is performed at full resolution, at grid level of the MCYFS or regional unmixed means (C-indicators) are used. Therefore a database has been set-up in order to provide the indicators based on a weighted average for each CORINE land cover class within an area of interest. The current work aims to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS. As a first step smoothing algorithms have to be applied to the time series to diminish noise effects. Therefore, existing methods as simple sliding windows, piecewise linear regression or fitting of polynomial functions are employed and compared. Thereafter, the time series analysis is performed with the aim to establish relationships between indicators profile features and the crop phenology},

abstract = {materials properties must be known to design novel applications. For example, bandgaps are critical for solar cells, optical spectra for organic electronics, vibrational spectra to discover new thermoelectrics for waste heat recovery, X-ray spectra for better medical diagnostic materials, or conductivity spectra for lightweight batteries with high storage capacity. Different spectroscopic techniques reveal different properties, and every material is characterized by a variety of spectra. Current spectroscopic methods, such as absorption, emission, scanning tunneling, Raman or electron-paramag-netic resonance, are well established. However, experiments are often time-consuming and sometimes require large, multi-million-Euro facilities, such as synchrotrons. Complementary theoretical spectroscopy methods based on quantum-mechanical first principles are similarly time consuming and require large-scale, high-performance computing facilities. Spectroscopy has seen many technical advances in individual spectroscopic methods, but no recent paradigm shift that would overcome the time-cost conundrum. Here we show that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to trigger such a conceptual breakthrough toward data driven spectroscopy. We present the first step toward building an AI-spectroscopist to harvest the wealth of already available spectroscopic data. The AI-spectroscopist is based on custom made deep neural networks that learn spectra of organic molecules. Our neural networks predict the peak positions of molecular ionization spectra with an average error as low as 0.19 eV and the spectral weight to within 3{\%}. This accuracy is already sufficient for our example application on photoemission spectra, which typically have an experimental resolution of several tenth of eV and theoretical error bars of 0.1-0.3 eV. Once trained, the AI-spectroscopist can make predictions of spectra instantly and at no further cost to the end-user. In this new paradigm, deep learning spectroscopy would complement conventional theoretical and experimental spec-troscopy to greatly accelerate the spectroscopic analysis of materials , make predictions for novel and hitherto uncharacterized materials, and discover entirely new molecules or materials. We demonstrate this by using our AI-spectroscopist to make predictions for a new dataset of organic molecules that was not used in training the deep neural networks. At no further Deep learning methods for the prediction of molecular excitation spectra are presented. For the example of the electronic density of states of 132k organic molecules, three different neural network architectures: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and deep tensor neural network (DTNN) are trained and assessed. The inputs for the neural networks are the coordinates and charges of the constituent atoms of each molecule. Already, the MLP is able to learn spectra, but the root mean square error (RMSE) is still as high as 0.3 eV. The learning quality improves significantly for the CNN (RMSE = 0.23 eV) and reaches its best performance for the DTNN (RMSE = 0.19 eV). Both CNN and DTNN capture even small nuances in the spectral shape. In a showcase application of this method, the structures of 10k previously unseen organic molecules are scanned and instant spectra predictions are obtained to identify molecules for potential applications.

abstract = {Global precipitation monitoring is essential for understanding the earth's water and energy cycle. Therefore, usage of satellite-based precipitation data is necessary where in situ data are rare. In addition,atmospheric-model-based reanalysis data feature global data coverage and offer a full catalog of atmospheric variables including precipitation. In this study, two model-based reanalysis products, the interim reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-Interim) and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), as well as two satellite-based datasets obtained by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCP) and Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data (HOAPS) are evaluated. The evaluation is based on monthly precipitation in the tropical Pacific Ocean during the time period 1989-2005. Rain-gauge atoll station data provided by the Pacific Rainfall Database (PACRAIN) are used as ground-based reference. It is shown that the analyzed precipitation datasets offer temporal correlations ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for absolute amounts and from 0.6 to 0.75 for monthly anomalies. Average monthly deviations are in the range of 20{\%}-30{\%}. GPCP offers the highest correlation and lowest monthly deviations with reference to PACRAIN station data. The HOAPS precipitation data perform in the range of the reanalysis precipitation datasets. In high native spatial resolution, HOAPS reveals deficiencies owing to its relatively sparse temporal coverage. This result emphasizes that temporal coverage is critical for controlling the performance of precipitation monitoring. Both reanalysis products show similar systematic behaviors in overestimating small and medium precipitation amounts and underestimating high amounts. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {8 The number of samples used in the calibration dataset affects the quality of the generated predictive models using visible, near 9 and shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR) spectroscopy for soil attributes. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is 10 regarded as a highly accurate model for predicting soil properties on a large database, however it has not been ascertained yet 11 how large the sample size should be for CNN model to be effective. This paper aims at providing an estimate of how much 12 calibration samples are needed to improve the model performance of soil properties predictions with CNN. It is hypothesized 13 that the larger the amount of data, the more accurate is the CNN model. The performances of two commonly used machine 14 learning models (Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Cubist) are compared against the CNN model. A VIS-NIR-SWIR 15 spectral library from Brazil containing 4251 unique sites, with averages of 2-3 samples per depth (a total of 12,044 samples), 16 was divided into calibration (3188 sites) and validation (1063 sites) sets. A subset of the calibration dataset was then created 17 to represent smaller calibration dataset ranging from 125, 300, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 2700 unique sites, or 18 equivalent to sample size approximately 350, 840, 1400, 2800, 4200, 5600, 7000, and 7650. All three models (PLSR, Cubist, 19 and CNN models) were generated for each sample size of the unique sites for the prediction of five different soil properties, 20 i.e. cation exchange capacity, organic matter, sand, silt and clay content. These calibration subset sampling processes and 21 modelling were repeated ten times to provide a better representation of the model performances. Similar results were observed 22 when the performances of both PLSR and Cubist model were compared to the CNN model where the performance of CNN 23 outweighed the PLSR and Cubist model at sample size of 1500 and 1800 respectively. It can be recommended that deep 24 learning is most efficient for spectral modelling for sample size above 2000. The accuracy of the PLSR and Cubist model 25 seemed to reach a plateau above sample size of 4200 and 5000 respectively. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the CNN 26 model to determine important wavelengths region that affected the predictions of various soil attributes. 27 Keywords: convolutional neural network, deep learning, machine learning, infrared spectroscopy, soil properties, soil analysis 28 29 https://doi.},

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of "good practice" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the "reference classification" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Long-term observations of vegetation phenology can be used to monitor the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Satellite remote sensing provides the most efficient means to observe phenological events through time series analysis of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study investigates the potential of a Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), which has been linked to vegetation light use efficiency, to improve the accuracy of MODIS-based estimates of phenology in an evergreen conifer forest. Timings of the start and end of the growing season (SGS and EGS) were derived from a 13-year-long time series of PRI and NDVI based on a MAIAC (multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction) processed MODIS dataset and standard MODIS NDVI product data. The derived dates were validated with phenology estimates from ground-based flux tower measurements of ecosystem productivity. Significant correlations were found between the MAIAC time series and ground-estimated SGS (R2= 0.36-0.8), which is remarkable since previous studies have found it difficult to observe inter-annual phenological variations in evergreen vegetation from satellite data. The considerably noisier NDVI product could not accurately predict SGS, and EGS could not be derived successfully from any of the time series. While the strongest relationship overall was found between SGS derived from the ground data and PRI, MAIAC NDVI exhibited high correlations with SGS more consistently (R2{\textgreater} 0.6 in all cases). The results suggest that PRI can serve as an effective indicator of spring seasonal transitions, however, additional work is necessary to confirm the relationships observed and to further explore the usefulness of MODIS PRI for detecting phenology.},

abstract = {In many regions worldwide, cropland abandonment is growing, which has strong and known environmental and socio-economic consequences. Yet, spatially explicit information on the spatial pattern of abandonment is sparse, particularly in post-Soviet countries of Central Asia. When thriving reaching for key Millennium Development Goals such as food security and poverty reduction, the issue of cropland abandonment is critical and therefore must be monitored and limited, or land use transformed into an alternative one. Central Asia experienced large changes of its agricultural system after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Land degradation, which started already before independence, and cropland abandonment is growing in extent, but their spatial pattern remains ill-understood. The objective of this study was to map and analyse agricultural land use in the irrigated areas of Kyzyl-Orda, southern Kazakhstan, Central Asia. For mapping land use and identifying abandoned agricultural land, an object-based classification approach was applied. Random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) algorithms permitted classifying Landsat and RapidEye data from 2009 to 2014. Overlaying these maps with information about irrigated land parcels, installed during the Soviet period, allowed indicating abandoned fields. Fusing the results of the two approaches, RF and SVM, resulted in classification accuracies of up to 97{\%}. This was statistically significantly higher than with RF or SVM alone. Through the analysis of the land use trajectories, abandoned agricultural fields and a clear indication of abandoned land were identified on almost 50{\%} of all fields in Kyzyl-Orda with an accuracy of approximately 80{\%}.

abstract = {IR spectroscopy and multivariate classification algorithms have great potential for detecting different viruses in the blood. Dengue, zika and chikungunya are arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes of genus Aedes . In clinical diagnostic routines, cross reactions between dengue and zika may occur because they are viruses of the same family (Flaviviridae); on the other hand, chikungunya is an alphavirus. In this study we suggest the use of FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with PCA-LDA, SPA-LDA and GA-LDA multivariate classification algorithms as a tool sensitive to biochemical variations caused by the presence of different viruses in the blood. We used 45 blood samples from patients diagnosed with dengue, 30 blood samples from patients diagnosed with zika, 10 samples from patients diagnosed with chikungunya and 45 blood samples from people without these viruses. The objective of the study was to evaluate, mainly, the specificity of the technique in discriminating the blood samples based only on the presence or absence of different viruses and to compare it with some standard diagnostic methods. The results showed sensitivity and specificity values of 100{\%} for the healthy, dengue and chikungunya classes and values close to 90{\%} for zika, suggesting that spectroscopic techniques have great potential for detecting the biochemical variations that the presence of the virus causes in the blood, through a fast methodology. },

abstract = {Summary Scientific investigation has long been dominated by positivism, which holds that an independent reality driven by immutable laws exists. Consequently, it should be possible to define sustainability in absolute terms. Advances in alternative paradigms, however, suggest: that any attempt precisely to define sustainability is flawed; that problems are always open to interpretation; that the resolution of one problem inevitably leads to the production of another ‘problem‐situation', as problems are endemic; that the key feature now becomes the capacity of actors continually to learn about these changing conditions, so that they can act rapidly to transform existing activities; and that systems of learning and inquiry are needed to seek the multiple perspectives of the various stakeholders and encourage wider involvement and action. These systems of inquiry are participatory in nature, and the information and action arising from them is judged by a framework of trustworthiness criteria.

All spectra were compared against a database of different synthetic and natural polymers by various routines followed by benchmark tests with focus on accuracy and quality. The spectral correlation was optimized for high quality data generation, which allowed image analysis. Based on these results an image analysis approach was developed, providing information on particle numbers and sizes for each polymer detected. It was possible to collect all data with relative ease even for complex sample matrices. This approach significantly decreases the time demand for the interpretation of complex FTIR-imaging data and significantly increases the data quality.},

abstract = {Farmland abandonment is a widespread land-use change in temperate regions, due to increasing yields on productive lands, conservation policies, and the increasing imports of agricultural products from other regions. Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1{\%} (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9{\%}), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4{\%} of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1. Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6. Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 11.2. Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s) Research on route-network stability is rare. In time, due to cultural and/or natural causes, settlement locations and route orientation shift. The nature of these spatial changes sheds light on the complex interaction between settlements and surrounding natural landscape conditions. This study investigates the stability of route networks in the Netherlands during the past two millennia by determining their persistence through time. Environmental, archaeological and historical data are used to reconstruct and compare route networks. By using network friction, archaeological data on settlement patterns and route networks in combination with historical data (e.g. old maps), we were able to model route-network persistence (not necessarily continuity) from the Roman to early medieval periods (AD 100–800) and from the Early Middle Ages to the Early Modern Times (AD 800–1600). Results show that around 67.6{\%} of the modelled early-medieval routes in the Netherlands are persistent with routes in the Roman period. Covering a much larger surface area of the Netherlands, 24.5{\%} of the early-modern routes show a clear persistence with their early-medieval counterparts. Besides the differences in surface area, this downfall can largely be explained by cultural dynamics, with 71.4{\%} of the early-modern route network following modelled movement corridors already in existence during the Early Middle Ages.},

abstract = {Originating in rural areas, the popular uprising that led to the Tunisian revolution of 14 January 2011 has shed light on the growing social and regional disparities that have characterized development dynamics in Tunisia. While favouring the reallocation of resources to coastal areas to the detriment of interior and agricultural regions, liberalization processes since the late 1980s also fostered export-oriented agricultural development strategies, based on the promotion of large-scale agricultural enterprises and irrigated farming. As a result, imports of grains and animal feed have come to represent a growing source of commercial balance deficit and of financial pressure on public budgets, particularly since the food crisis of 2008. On the other hand, decreasing farm subsidies, higher production costs, growing farmers' indebtedness, have importantly reduced the reproduction capacity of a large fraction of farms, particularly in the rain-fed agriculture sector. As rural outmigration and non-farm employment opportunities have been declining, small farms have become survival spaces for jobless household members, increasing the pressure on family resources and exacerbating social frustrations. While rising food prices were not the only cause of recent uprisings in Tunisia, processes of agricultural restructuring during the past 20 years contributed importantly to fuel the revolutionary dynamics, thus giving a political dimension to food issues. As demonstrated by the rise of farmers' protest movement (land occupations, contestation of farmers unions, refusal to pay for irrigation water), structural change allowing for an increased control of economic resources by local farm producers is needed, but will fundamentally depend on the effectiveness of current process of 'democratic' transition in Tunisia.

abstract = {Traditionally, logic has been claimed to be 'the science of rational argument', but the relevance to our everyday disputes of the formal logician's results has remained unclear. The abstract character of traditional logic cuts the subject off from practical considerations; Mr Toulmin enquires why this is so, and shows how an alternative conception can be of more general value. Starting from an examination of the actual procedures in different fields of argument - the practice, as opposed to the theory, of logic - he discloses a richer variety than is allowed for by any available system. He argues that jurisprudence rather than mathematics should be the logician's model in analysing rational procedures, and that logic should be a comparative and not a purely formal study. These suggestions lead to conclusions which many will consider controversial; though they will also be widely recognized as interesting and illuminating. This book extends into general philosophy lines of enquiry already sketched by Mr Toulmin in his earlier books on ethics and the philosophy of science. The ordinary reader will find in it the same clarity and intelligibility; and the professional philosopher will acknowledge the same power to break new ground (and circumvent old difficulties) by posing fresh and stimulating questions.},

@article{Karkauskaite2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Satellite remote sensing of plant phenology provides an important indicator of climate change. However, start of the growing season (SOS) estimates in Northern Hemisphere boreal forest areas are known to be challenged by the presence of seasonal snow cover and limited seasonality in the greenness signal for evergreen needleleaf forests, which can both bias and impede trend estimates of SOS. The newly developed Plant Phenology Index (PPI) was specifically designed to overcome both problems. Here we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2000-2014) to analyze the ability of PPI for estimating start of season (SOS) in boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in comparison to two other widely applied indices for SOS retrieval: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Satellite-based SOS is evaluated against gross primary production (GPP)-retrieved SOS derived from a network of flux tower observations in boreal areas (a total of 81 site-years analyzed). Spatiotemporal relationships between SOS derived from PPI, EVI and NDVI are furthermore studied for different boreal land cover types and regions. The overall correlation between SOS derived from VIs and ground measurements was rather low, but PPI performed significantly better (r = 0.50, p {\textless} 0.01) than EVI and NDVI which both showed a very poor correlation (r = 0.11, p = 0. 16 and r = 0.08, p = 0.24). PPI, EVI and NDVI overall produce similar trends in SOS for the Northern Hemisphere showing an advance in SOS towards earlier dates (0.28, 0.23 and 0.26 days/year), but a pronounced difference in trend estimates between PPI and EVI/NDVI is observed for different land cover types. Deciduous needleleaf forest is characterized by the largest advance in SOS when considering all indices, yet PPI showed less dramatic changes as compared to EVI/NDVI (0.47 days/year as compared to 0.62 and 0.74). PPI SOS trends were found to be higher for deciduous broadleaf forests and savannas (0.54 and 0.56 days/year). Taken together, the findings of this study suggest improved performance of PPI over NDVI and EVI in retrieval of SOS in boreal regions and precautions must be taken when interpreting spatio-temporal patterns of SOS from the latter two indices.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) offer users the ability to capture large amounts of imagery at unprecedented spatial resolutions due to their flexible designs, low costs, automated workflows, and minimal technical knowledge barriers. Their rapid extension into new disciplines promotes the necessity to question and understand the implications of data capture and processing parameter decisions on the respective output completeness. This research provides a culmination of quantitative insight using an eBee Plus, fixed-wing UAS for collecting robust data on complex forest environments. These analyses differentiate from measures of accuracy, which were derived from positional comparison to other data sources, to instead guide applications of comprehensive coverage. Our results demonstrated the impacts of flying height on Structure from Motion (SfM) processing completeness, discrepancies in outputs based on software package choice, and the effects caused by processing parameter settings. For flying heights of 50 m, 100 m, and 120 m above the forest canopy, key quality indicators within the software demonstrated the superior performance of the 100-m flying height. These indicators included, among others, image alignment success, the average number of tie points per image, and planimetric model ground sampling distance. We also compared the output results of two leading SfM software packages: Agisoft PhotoScan and Pix4D Mapper Pro. Agisoft PhotoScan maintained an 11.8{\%} greater image alignment success and a 9.91{\%} finer planimetric model resolution. Lastly, we compared the {\&}ldquo;high{\&}rdquo; and {\&}ldquo;medium{\&}rdquo; resolution processing workflows in Agisoft PhotoScan. The high-resolution processing setting achieved a 371{\%} increase in point cloud density, with a 3.1{\%} coarser planimetric model resolution, over a considerably longer processing time. As UAS continue to expand their sphere of influence and develop technologically, best-use practices based on aerial photogrammetry principles must remain apparent to achieve optimal results.},

abstract = {Understanding how different crops use water over time is essential for planning and managing water allocation, water rights, and agricultural production. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop water use in the Central Valley of California using Landsat-based annual actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from 2008 to 2018 derived from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. Crop water use for 10 crops is characterized at multiple scales. The Mann{\&}ndash;Kendall trend analysis revealed a significant increase in area cultivated with almonds and their water use, with an annual rate of change of 16,327 ha in area and 13,488 ha-m in water use. Conversely, alfalfa showed a significant decline with 12,429 ha in area and 13,901 ha-m in water use per year during the same period. A pixel-based Mann{\&}ndash;Kendall trend analysis showed the changing crop type and water use at the level of individual fields for all of Kern County in the Central Valley. This study demonstrates the useful application of historical Landsat ET to produce relevant water management information. Similar studies can be conducted at regional and global scales to understand and quantify the relationships between land cover change and its impact on water use.},

@article{Al-Najjar2019,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In recent years, remote sensing researchers have investigated the use of different modalities (or combinations of modalities) for classification tasks. Such modalities can be extracted via a diverse range of sensors and images. Currently, there are no (or only a few) studies that have been done to increase the land cover classification accuracy via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)–digital surface model (DSM) fused datasets. Therefore, this study looks at improving the accuracy of these datasets by exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we focus on the fusion of DSM and UAV images for land use/land cover mapping via classification into seven classes: bare land, buildings, dense vegetation/trees, grassland, paved roads, shadows, and water bodies. Specifically, we investigated the effectiveness of the two datasets with the aim of inspecting whether the fused DSM yields remarkable outcomes for land cover classification. The datasets were: (i) only orthomosaic image data (Red, Green and Blue channel data), and (ii) a fusion of the orthomosaic image and DSM data, where the final classification was performed using a CNN. CNN, as a classification method, is promising due to hierarchical learning structure, regulating and weight sharing with respect to training data, generalization, optimization and parameters reduction, automatic feature extraction and robust discrimination ability with high performance. The experimental results show that a CNN trained on the fused dataset obtains better results with Kappa index of {\~{}}0.98, an average accuracy of 0.97 and final overall accuracy of 0.98. Comparing accuracies between the CNN with DSM result and the CNN without DSM result for the overall accuracy, average accuracy and Kappa index revealed an improvement of 1.2{\%}, 1.8{\%} and 1.5{\%}, respectively. Accordingly, adding the heights of features such as buildings and trees improved the differentiation between vegetation specifically where plants were dense.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The changing climate is posing significant threats to agriculture, the most vulnerable sector, and the main source of livelihood in West Africa. This study assesses the impact of the climate-departure on the crop suitability and planting month over West Africa. We used 10 CMIP5 Global climate models bias-corrected simulations downscaled by the CORDEX regional climate model, RCA4 to drive the crop suitability model, Ecocrop. We applied the concept of the crop-climate departure (CCD) to evaluate future changes in the crop suitability and planting month for five crop types, cereals, legumes, fruits, root and tuber and horticulture over the historical and future months. Our result shows a reduction (negative linear correlation) and an expansion (positive linear correlation) in the suitable area and crop suitability index value in the Guinea-Savanna and Sahel (southern Sahel) zone, respectively. The horticulture crop was the most negatively affected with a decrease in the suitable area while cereals and legumes benefited from the expansion in suitable areas into the Sahel zone. In general, CCD would likely lead to a delay in the planting season by 2–4 months except for the orange and early planting dates by about 2–3 months for cassava. No projected changes in the planting month are observed for the plantain and pineapple which are annual crops. The study is relevant for a short and long-term adaptation option and planning for future changes in the crop suitability and planting month to improve food security in the region.},

abstract = {Geographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is increasingly used to process high-spatial resolution imagery, with applications ranging from single species detection to habitat and land cover mapping. Image segmentation plays a key role in GEOBIA workflows, allowing to partition images into homogenous and mutually exclusive regions. Nonetheless, segmentation techniques require a robust parameterization to achieve the best results. Frequently, inappropriate parameterization leads to sub-optimal results and difficulties in comparing distinct methods. Here, we present an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize image segmentation parameters by using the performance scores from object-based classification, thus allowing to assess the adequacy of a segmented image in relation to the classification problem. This approach was implemented in a new R package called SegOptim, in which several segmentation algorithms are interfaced, mostly from open-source software (GRASS GIS, Orfeo Toolbox, RSGISLib, SAGA GIS, TerraLib), but also from proprietary software (ESRI ArcGIS). SegOptim also provides access to several machine-learning classification algorithms currently available in R, including Gradient Boosted Modelling, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We tested our approach using very-high to high spatial resolution images collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (0.03 – 0.10 m), WorldView-2 (2 m), RapidEye (5 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 – 20 m) in six different test sites located in northern Portugal with varying environmental conditions and for different purposes, including invasive species detection and land cover mapping. The results highlight the added value of our novel comparison of image segmentation and classification algorithms. Overall classification performances (assessed through cross-validation with the Kappa index) ranged from 0.85 to 1.00. Pilot-tests show that our GA-based approach is capable of providing sound results for optimizing the parameters of different segmentation algorithms, with benefits for classification accuracy and for comparison across techniques. We also verified that no particular combination of an image segmentation and a classification algorithm is suited for all the tasks/objectives. Consequently, it is crucial to compare and optimize available methods to understand which one is more suited for a certain objective. Our approach allows a closer integration between the segmentation and classification stages, which is of high importance for GEOBIA workflows. The results from our tests confirm that this integration has benefits for comparing and optimizing both processes. We discuss some limitations of the SegOptim approach (and potential solutions) as well as a future roadmap to expand its current functionalities.},

abstract = {Matching spectra is necessary for database searches, assessing the source of an unknown sample, structure elucidation, and classification of spectra. A direct method of matching is to compare, point by point, two digitized spectra, the outcome being a parameter that quantifies the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the spectra. Examples studied here are correlation coefficient squared and Euclidean cosine squared, both applied to the raw spectra and first-difference values of absorbance. It is shown that spectra do not fulfill the requirements for a normal statistical interpretation of the correlation coefficient; in particular, they are not normally distributed variables. It is therefore not correct to use a Student's t-test to calculate the probability of the null hypothesis that two spectra are not correlated on the basis of a correlation coefficient between them. We have investigated the effect on the similarity indices of systematically changing the mean and standard deviation of a single Gaussian peak relative to a reference Gaussian peak, of changing one peak, and of changing many peaks, in a simulated 10-peak spectrum. Squared Euclidean cosine is least sensitive to changes and the first-difference methods are most sensitive to changes in mean and standard deviation of peaks. A shift of the center of a peak has a greater effect on the indices than increases in peak width, but a decrease in peak width does lead to significant changes in the indices. We recommend that if these indices are to be used to match spectra, appropriate windows should be chosen to avoid dilution by regions with no significant change. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Soil biodiversity plays a key role in regulating the processes that underpin the delivery of ecosystem goods and services in terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural intensification is known to change the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, but less is known about how intensification affects biodiversity of the soil food web as a whole, and whether or not these effects may be generalized across regions. We examined biodiversity in soil food webs from grasslands, extensive, and intensive rotations in four agricultural regions across Europe: in Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic and Greece. Effects of land-use intensity were quantified based on structure and diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as well as on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. We also elucidate land-use intensity effects on diversity of taxonomic units within taxonomic groups of soil fauna. We found that between regions soil food web diversity measures were variable, but that increasing land-use intensity caused highly consistent responses. In particular, land-use intensification reduced the complexity in the soil food webs, as well as the community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. In all regions across Europe, species richness of earthworms, Collembolans, and oribatid mites was negatively affected by increased land-use intensity. The taxonomic distinctness, which is a measure of taxonomic relatedness of species in a community that is independent of species richness, was also reduced by land-use intensification. We conclude that intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity, making soil food webs less diverse and composed of smaller bodied organisms. Land-use intensification results in fewer functional groups of soil biota with fewer and taxonomically more closely related species. We discuss how these changes in soil biodiversity due to land-use intensification may threaten the functioning of soil in agricultural production systems.},

abstract = {Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning.In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92{\%} overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20{\%}, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Information on the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice fields is needed for trace gas emission estimates, management of water resources, and food security. Paddy rice fields are characterized by an initial period of flooding and transplanting, during which period open canopy (a mixture of surface water and rice crops) exists. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the NASA EOS Terra satellite has visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands; and therefore, a number of vegetation indices can be calculated, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) that is sensitive to leaf water and soil moisture. In this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping algorithm that uses time series of three vegetation indices (LSWI, EVI, and NDVI) derived from MODIS images to identify that initial period of flooding and transplanting in paddy rice fields, based on the sensitivity of LSWI to the increased surface moisture during the period of flooding and rice transplanting. We ran the algorithm to map paddy rice fields in 13 provinces of southern China, using the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance products (500-m spatial resolution) in 2002. The resultant MODIS-derived paddy rice map was evaluated, using the National Land Cover Dataset (1:100,000 scale) derived from analysis of Landsat ETM+ images in 1999/2000. There were reasonable agreements in area estimates of paddy rice fields between the MODIS-derived map and the Landsat-based dataset at the provincial and county levels. The results of this study indicated that the MODIS-based paddy rice mapping algorithm could potentially be applied at large spatial scales to monitor paddy rice agriculture on a timely and frequent basis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-{\`{a}}-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7{\%} and 14{\%} greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6{\%} difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

CDIAC TR051 was, therefore, combined with GHCN{\_}GRD for 1925 without any inhomogeneities found in the combined time series. Around Lake Balkhash, negative precipitation anomalies prevailed from 1872 to 1950 with a significant recovery found around 1900. IPCC AR4 indicated that precipitation increased in Central Asia throughout the 20th century, whereas this study clarified that the increasing trend has been presented since 1872 in the study area. Moreover, the integral curve of the precipitation anomalies corresponded well with variation of the water level of Lake Balkhash, i.e., negative precipitation anomalies from 1872 onward resulted in the continuous decrease of the water level until 1950. This coincides with other proxy data such as a sediment core of Lake Balkhash dug up in 2007.},

The waters are regarded as the key strategic natural resources having the potential to be the catalyst for all round development and economic growth of the country. The vision of the future is that Nepal's poverty can be eliminated by water resources development led through agricultural growth. The strategy for economic development, employment and poverty alleviation is based on the background of the country's unexploited potential in the agriculture sector given by suitable agro ecology, substantial irrigation potential, low technology use at present, possibility of regional cooperation and large market across the border and engagement of about 80{\%} population in agriculture. Water resource planning approach in the country had been concentrated at sub-sector level and investment decisions made on a project by project basis. This fragmented manner of planning by different government organizations have so far, failed to address the complex and interrelated issues. Multiple users: agriculture, domestic water agencies and industry -utilize the water resources of each river basin without any special attention to river basin water availability. The groundwater resource in the terai plains is grossly under utilized and needs legislative measures for its planned development and management. Details about issues, and constraints, trade offs about alternative choices and various alternatives are to be analyzed under the ongoing national water resources strategy formulation. The identified outstanding issues related to irrigated agriculture include (i) developed irrigation facilities not utilized to the optimum; (ii) lack of basic inputs; (iii) organization and management},

abstract = {Fisheries in arid countries of Central Asia and in Kazakhstan have a relatively short tradition of less than 100 years. However during this period, water resources, originating largely from snow and ice melt, have been subject to large-scale engineering interference required by the growing demands for the expansion of irrigated agriculture. Storage and diversion of flow into irrigation systems have affected original fish stocks through change, in river discharges, blockage of migratory pathways by dams and barrages, increase in dissolved salt content and agrochemicals in drainage waters. In order to boost the indigenous fish stocks, which often give poor yields, fishery managers transferred a number of fish species from other parts of Asia within the ex-Soviet Union. In order to improve the food base for such fish, fish food organisms such as mysids, gammarids and molluscs were also transferred. The introductions often increased fish yields only temporarily or interfered with the indigenous stocks. In addition to valuable fish species, unwanted fish were sometimes brought in. Where river basins became interconnected through canals, fish faunas of these basins intermingled through immigration of species. The new fish communities now form a mixture of indigenous and introduced fish, where one can rarely assume that a balanced state has been achieved. The priority of the governments remains the use of water for irrigation and hydropower production, which leaves fishery managers in the unenviable position of adjusting the management to the continuously changing situation, which is often unpredictable. In order to increase fish production present government strategies focus on the rehabilitation of rivers and terminal lakes with the aim of arresting and reversing the process of salinization of waters and of maintaining water level in lakes. This allows fishery managers to develop strategies for optimizing fish yields under more stable conditions. With the new efforts to revitalize the Aral Sea, the large artificial terminal lakes established from drainage and wash waters, will become of minor importance for fisheries, as their salinity will increase beyond the tolerance level of most fish. However, in fresh-water reservoirs and lakes, including those formed from seepage in depressions near irrigation canals, there is considerable potential for raising fish yields. Culture-enhanced methodologies, when introduced, should also lead to substantial increases in fish production from these water bodies.},

abstract = {Although hyperparasitism frequently occur in parasitic insects, many aspects of this strategy remain unknown. We investigated possible fitness costs of hyperparasitism as influenced by host size. Our study was conducted with the facultative hyperparasitoid Pachycrepoideus dubius Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), which parasitizes host species differing greatly in size. We compared some fitness traits (level of successful parasitism, development time, sex ratio and offspring size) of P. dubius developing on large secondary / primary (Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)/ Trybliographa rapae Westwood (Hymenoptera: Figitidae)) or small secondary / primary host species (Drosophila melanogaster L. / Asobara tabida Nees (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)). In no-choice and choice experiments, P. dubius was able to develop on different stages of T. rapae (L2 (endophagous), L4 (ectophagous), and pupae) but that it preferred to parasitize unparasitized D. radicum pupae over pupae parasitized by T. rapae. Furthermore, in P. dubius, hyperparasitism was associated with fitness costs (lower level of successful parasitism, smaller adult size) and these costs were greater on the smallest host complex. We hypothesize that the size of D. melanogaster pupae parasitized by A. tabida may be close to the suboptimal host size for P. dubius beneath which the costs of hyperparasitism make this strategy nonadaptive. Hyperparasitism in terms of trade-offs between host quality and abundance of competitors is discussed.},

abstract = {Land use classification is an important part of many remote sensing applications. A lot of research has gone into the application of statistical and neural network classifiers to remote-sensing images. This research involves the study and implementation of a new pattern recognition technique introduced within the framework of statistical learning theory called Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and its application to remote-sensing image classification. Standard classifiers such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) need a number of training samples that exponentially increase with the dimension of the input feature space. With a limited number of training samples, the classification rate thus decreases as the dimensionality increases. SVMs are independent of the dimensionality of feature space as the main idea behind this classification technique is to separate the classes with a surface that maximizes the margin between them, using boundary pixels to create the decision surface. Results from SVMs are compared with traditional Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and an ANN classifier. The findings suggest that the ANN and SVM classifiers perform better than the traditional MLC. The SVM and the ANN show comparable results. However, accuracy is dependent on factors such as the number of hidden nodes (in the case of ANN) and kernel parameters (in the case of SVM). The training time taken by the SVM is several magnitudes less.},

abstract = {Central Asia's Ili River is fed by mountain streams that flow down into an isolated and arid basin that today is shared by Kazakhstan and China. Agriculture in the basin is dependent upon irrigation, which was practiced as long ago as the Iron Age, when early pastoralists constructed ditches to channel water from streams onto nearby fields. Irrigation had become much more common by the 18th century, when the region was controlled by the Dzungarian Khanate. The khanate was toppled by the Qing Chinese in the 1750s in the first of a series of confrontations that destroyed and then rebuilt the basin's agricultural economy. The region has since been dominated by a succession of Chinese and Russian (and later Soviet and independent Kazakh) governments, each of which recognized the essential role of irrigated agriculture in maintaining control. Thus every cycle of destruction led to reclamation of new lands, resettlement of farmers and upgrading of infrastructure to expand irrigation. This allowed an impressive diversity of fruits, vegetables and field crops to be grown, especially on loess soils of the more fertile upper basin, where tributaries could be easily tapped by gravity flow. Many of these tributaries were entirely diverted by the 19th century, so that they no longer reached the Ili. Large scale irrigation commenced in the 1960s, when the Soviets built Kapchagai dam and reservoir in the lower part of the basin and installed pumps to raise water from the Ili River onto nearby reclaimed sierozem soils, mostly for cultivation of rice. China later constructed a cluster of small- and medium-sized dams that enabled expansion of agriculture in the upper part of the basin. Many irrigated areas along the lower reaches of the Ili in Kazakhstan have been abandoned, but irrigation in the upper basin continues to expand. Declining soil fertility, salinization, pollution, insufficient inflows and adverse economic conditions currently challenge irrigation across the entire basin. Investments are being made in new technologies as a means to sustain irrigated agriculture in the basin, but it remains to be seen if these strategies will be successful.},

abstract = {Land cover change assessment is one of the main applications of remote sensed data. A number of pixel based classification algorithms have been developed over the past years for the analysis of remotely sensed data. The most notable include the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), support vector machines (SVMs) and the decision trees (DTs). The DTs in particular offer advantages not provided by other approaches. They are computationally fast and make no statistical assumptions regarding the distribution of data. The challenge to using DTs lies in the determination of the "best" tree structure and the decision boundaries. Recent developments in the field of data mining have however, provided an alternative for overcoming the above shortcomings. In this study, we analysed the potential of DTs as one technique for data mining for the analysis of the 1986 and 2001 Landsat TM and ETM+ datasets, respectively. The results were compared with those obtained using SVMs, and MLC. Overall, acceptable accuracies of over 85{\%} were obtained in all the cases. In general, the DTs performed better than both MLC and SVMs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way.

The conceptual framework was developed by modifying Ken Wilber's All Quadrants, All Levels (AQAL) approach, and focuses on the inter-relatedness/inter- connection of various perspectives inherent to the concept of sustainability. To look at how our framework can facilitate the practice of sustainability assessment, we apply the framework to examine the relationships between social systems and the environmental changes in the Ili River basin across the period 1900-2008. This approach enables us to investigate the environmental problems of the Ili River basin in a four-quadrant framework, and combine the empirics of quadrants obtained from traditional disciplinary methodologies. The four-quadrant framework adopted in this study illustrates the interlocking relationships among various perspectives of environmental issues in the Ili River basin, namely, physical perspective, personal perspective, cultural perspective, and social perspective. In particular, the protruding development (evolution) of the lower right dimension is the fundamental cause of the environmental degradation and its related social problems in the Ili River basin. Compared to other established approaches in literature that emphasize on the tradeoffs of various perspectives of sustainability, our findings indicate the potential contributions of four-quadrant framework to sustainability assessment through its focus on the inter-relatedness/inter-connection of different perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Agriculture is expanding and intensifying in many areas of the world, but abandoned agriculture is also becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe ({\~{}}1,236,000km 2) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, {\~{}}250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65{\%}. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1{\%} of the total area, compared to 29.6{\%} agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8{\%} producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003-2008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8{\%} over the use of NDVI data alone. The approach that we identified here is promising and suggests that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales, which is relevant to gain a better understanding of this important land use change process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

As a consequence the land use activities in urban and suburban areas are changing dramatically. To provide cost-effective information about the current state and how it is changing in order to develop integrated policies, multi-temporal remotely sensed data, with its synoptic and regular coverage, is being used. Nevertheless, the mapping and monitoring of urban change through remote sensing is difficult owing to the complex urban land use patterns. Although many image processing techniques have been developed for this purpose, they are complicated by differences amongst images caused by differences in the effects of the atmosphere, illumination, and surface moisture. One technique which is relatively unaffected by these problems is based on artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms. The main objective of this study was to examine the performance of two ANN classifiers for land use classification using Landsat TM data. Two different supervised ANN approaches were used: the multi layer perceptron (MLP) and the learning vector quantization (LVQ). The performance of these classifiers was compared to the more conventional maximum likelihood approach.},

abstract = {Lake Balkhash is a large (18,000 km3), closed, and slightly saline lake in the south-west of Kazakhstan. It is divided into two basins, a south-western and an eastern basin. These have somewhat different limnological conditions, but the most obvious one is that the south-western basin has a salinity of {\textless}2 g L-1 whereas the salinity of the eastern basin is ∼4 g L-1. Numerous fish and invertebrate introductions, many successful, have been made. In 1969, a dam impounding the Kapchagay reservoir was constructed on the River Ili, the major river flowing into the lake. The impoundment of water in this reservoir caused a fall of some 1.5 m in the water-level of the lake. This fall, together with other events on the catchment, caused considerable damage to reedswamps in the lake, to the fishery and to conservation values. A number of suggestions has been made on how to prevent further damage. Some, particularly those involving a moratorium on further filling of Kapchagay reservoir and irrigation, have been implemented, at least in part. This has caused some remission in environmental damage and provides for cautious optimism with regard to the lake's future. Even so, the environmental status of the lake remains vulnerable and many dangers persist. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The importance of mapping regional and global cropland distribution in timely ways has been recognized, but separation of crop types and multiple cropping patterns is challenging due to their spectral similarity. This study developed a new approach to identify crop types (including soy, cotton and maize) and cropping patterns (Soy-Maize, Soy-Cotton, Soy-Pasture, Soy-Fallow, Fallow-Cotton and Single crop) in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data for 2015 and 2016 and field survey data were used in this research. The major steps of this proposed approach include: (1) reconstructing NDVI time series data by removing the cloud-contaminated pixels using the temporal interpolation algorithm, (2) identifying the best periods and developing temporal indices and phenological parameters to distinguish croplands from other land cover types, and (3) developing crop temporal indices to extract cropping patterns using NDVI time-series data and group cropping patterns into crop types. Decision tree classifier was used to map cropping patterns based on these temporal indices. Croplands from Landsat imagery in 2016, cropping pattern samples from field survey in 2016, and the planted area of crop types in 2015 were used for accuracy assessment. Overall accuracies of approximately 90{\%}, 73{\%} and 86{\%}, respectively were obtained for croplands, cropping patterns, and crop types. The adjusted coefficients of determination of total crop, soy, maize, and cotton areas with corresponding statistical areas were 0.94, 0.94, 0.88 and 0.88, respectively. This research indicates that the proposed approach is promising for mapping large-scale croplands, their cropping patterns and crop types.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of "good practice" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the "reference classification" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of water depletion in the irrigated land of Khorezm, a region located in Central Asia in the lower floodplains of the Amu Darya River, were mapped and monitored by means of MODIS land products. Land cover and land use were classified by using a recursive partitioning and regression tree with 250 m MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETact) was obtained by applying the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to 1 km daily MODIS data. Elements of the SEBAL based METRIC model (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) were adopted and modified. The upstream–downstream difference in irrigation was reflected by analyzing agricultural land use and amounts of depleted water (ETact) using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The validity of the MODIS albedo and emissivity used for modeling ETact was assessed with data extracted from literature. The r 2 value of 0.6 indicated a moderate but significant association between ETact and class-A-pan evaporation. Deviations of ETact from the 10-day reference evapotranspiration of wheat and cotton were found to be explainable. In Khorezm, seasonal maximum values superior to 1,200 and 1,000 mm ETact were estimated for rice and cotton fields, respectively. Spatio-temporal comparisons of agricultural land use with seasonal ETact disclosed unequal water consumption in Khorezm. Seasonal ETact on agricultural land decreased with increasing distance to the water intake points of the irrigation system (972–712 mm). Free MODIS data provided reliable, exhaustive, and consistent information on water use relevant for decision support in Central Asian water management.},

abstract = {Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data. Various ensemble classification methods have been proposed in recent years. These methods have been proven to improve classification accuracy considerably. The most widely used ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known ensemble methods on multisource remote sensing and geographic data. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The demand for agricultural products continues to grow rapidly, but further agricultural expansion entails substantial environmental costs, making recultivating currently unused farmland an interesting alternative. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to widespread abandonment of agricultural lands, but the extent and spatial patterns of abandonment are unclear. We quantified the extent of abandoned farmland, both croplands and pastures, across the region using MODIS NDVI satellite image time series from 2004 to 2006 and support vector machine classifications. Abandoned farmland was widespread, totaling 52.5 Mha, particularly in temperate European Russia (32 Mha), northern and western Ukraine, and Belarus. Differences in abandonment rates among countries were striking, suggesting that institutional and socio-economic factors were more important in determining the amount of abandonment than biophysical conditions. Indeed, much abandoned farmland occurred in areas without major constraints for agriculture. Our map provides a basis for assessing the potential of Central and Eastern Europe's abandoned agricultural lands to contribute to food or bioenergy production, or carbon storage, as well as the environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.},

In this paper, we analyzed the major drivers affecting shared water vulnerability in China, namely: (1) changes in physical conditions affecting the availability of water; (2) competing objectives between economic development and ecological conservation; (3) lack of emergency response mechanisms; (4) unsound administrative institutions; and (5) shortcomings in the development of regional cooperation based on transboundary waters. We concluded by identifying four pathways for reducing vulnerability: (1) encouraging scientific research cooperation; (2) constructing information-sharing channels; (3) establishing early-warning mechanisms; and (4) promoting further coordination and negotiation.},

Based on remotely sensed data of land use change with the spatial resolution of 1km X 1km on national scale among every five years, this paper designed a new dynamic regionalization according to the comprehensive characteristics of land use including regional differentiation, physical, economic, and macro-policy factors as well. Spatial pattern of land use change and its driving forces were investigated in Chia in the early 21st century. To sum up, land use pattern of this period was characterized by rapid changes in the whole country. Over the agricultural zones,e.g., Huang-Huai-Hai Plains, the southeast coastal area and Sichuan Basin, the built-up and residential areas were considerably expanded to a great proportion in the northwestern oasis agricultural zones and the northeastern zone led to a slight increase of arable land aea in the northern China. Due to the "grain for green" policy, forest area was significantly increased in the middle and western developing region, Where the vegetation coverage was substanially enlarged, likewise. This paper argued the main driving forces as the implementation of the strategy on land use and regional development, such as the "Western Development", "the Revitalization of the Northeast" policy, coupled with rapidly economic development during this period.},

abstract = {Institutional settings play a key role in shaping land cover and land use. Our goal was to understand the effects of institutional changes on agricultural land abandonment in different countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of socialism. We studied similar to 273 800 km(2) (eight Landsat footprints) within one agro-ecological zone stretching across Poland, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania and European Russia. Multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite images centered on 1990 (the end of socialism) and 2000 (one decade after the end of socialism) were used to classify agricultural land abandonment using support vector machines. The results revealed marked differences in the abandonment rates between countries. The highest rates of land abandonment were observed in Latvia (42{\%} of all agricultural land in 1990 was abandoned by 2000), followed by Russia (31{\%}), Lithuania (28{\%}), Poland (14{\%}) and Belarus (13{\%}). Cross-border comparisons revealed striking differences; for example, in the Belarus-Russia cross-border area there was a great difference between the rates of abandonment of the two countries (10{\%} versus 47{\%} of abandonment). Our results highlight the importance of institutions and policies for land-use trajectories and demonstrate that radically different combinations of institutional change of strong institutions during the transition can reduce the rate of agricultural land abandonment (e.g., in Belarus and in Poland). Inversely, our results demonstrate higher abandonment rates for countries where the institutions that regulate land use changed and where the institutions took more time to establish (e.g., Latvia, Lithuania and Russia). Better knowledge regarding the effects of such broad-scale change is essential for understanding land-use change and for designing effective land-use policies. This information is particularly relevant for Northern Eurasia, where rapid land-use change offers vast opportunities for carbon balance and biodiversity, and for increasing agricultural production on previously cultivated lands.},

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

abstract = {Object-based image classification for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and land-cover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6{\%} of studies involve an area less than 300 ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2 m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classification. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classification accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised object-based image classification.},

abstract = {As the Earth's population continues to grow and demand for food increases, the need for improved and timely information related to the properties and dynamics of global agricultural systems is becoming increasingly important. Global land cover maps derived from satellite data provide indispensable information regarding the geographic distribution and areal extent of global croplands. However, land use information, such as cropping intensity (defined here as the number of cropping cycles per year), is not routinely available over large areas because mapping this information from remote sensing is challenging. In this study, we present a simple but efficient algorithm for automated mapping of cropping intensity based on data from NASA's (NASA: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The proposed algorithm first applies an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series derived from MODIS surface reflectance data. It then uses an iterative moving-window methodology to identify cropping cycles from the smoothed EVI time series. Comparison of results from our algorithm with national survey data at both the provincial and prefectural level in China show that the algorithm provides estimates of gross sown area that agree well with inventory data. Accuracy assessment comparing visually interpreted time series with algorithm results for a random sample of agricultural areas in China indicates an overall accuracy of 91.0{\%} for three classes defined based on the number of cycles observed in EVI time series. The algorithm therefore appears to provide a straightforward and efficient method for mapping cropping intensity from MODIS time series data.},

abstract = {Further cropland expansion might be unavoidable to satisfy the growing demand for land-based products and ecosystem services. A crucial issue is thus to assess the trade-offs between social and ecological impacts and the benefits of converting additional land to cropland. In the former Soviet Union countries, where the transition from state-command to market-driven economies resulted in widespread agricultural land abandonment, cropland expansion may incur relatively low costs, especially compared with tropical regions. Our objectives were to quantify the drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland to assess the potentially available cropland in European Russia, western Siberia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan-the region where the vast majority of post-Soviet cropland abandonment took place. Using spatial panel regressions, we characterized the socio-economic determinants of cropland abandonment and recultivation. We then used recent maps of changes in cropland to (i) spatially characterize the socio-economic, accessibility and soil constraints associated with the recultivation of abandoned croplands and (ii) investigate the environmental trade-offs regarding carbon stocks and habitat for biodiversity. Less cropland abandonment and more recultivation after 2000 occurred in areas with an increasing rural population and a younger labor force, but also improved yields. Synergies were observed between cropland recultivation and intensification over the 2000s. From 47.3 million hectares (Mha) of cropland abandoned in 2009, we identified only 8.5 (7.1-17.4). Mha of potentially available cropland with low environmental trade-offs and low to moderate socio-economic or accessibility constraints that were located on high-quality soils (Chernozems). These areas represented an annual wheat production potential of {\~{}}14.3 (9.6-19.5). million tons (Mt). Conversely, 8.5 (4.2-12.4). Mha had high carbon or biodiversity trade-offs, of which {\~{}}10{\%} might be attractive for cropland expansion and thus would require protection from recultivation. Agro-environmental, accessibility, and socio-economic constraints suggested that the remaining 30.6 (25.7-30.6). Mha of abandoned croplands were unlikely to provide important contributions to future crop production at current wheat prices but could provide various ecosystem services, and some could support extensive livestock production. Political and institutional support could foster recultivation by supporting investments in agriculture and rural demographic revitalization. Reclaiming potentially available cropland in the study region could provide a notable contribution to global grain production, with relatively low environmental trade-offs compared with tropical frontiers, but is not a panacea to address global issues of food security or reduce land-use pressure on tropical ecosystems.},

abstract = {With the recession of the Aral Sea in Central Asia, once the world's fourth largest lake, a huge new saline desert emerged which is nowadays called the Aralkum. Saline soils in the Aralkum are a major source for dust and salt storms in the region. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal land cover change dynamics in the Aralkum and discuss potential implications for the  recent and future dust and salt storm activity in the region. MODIS satellite time series were classified from 2000-2008 and change of land cover was quantified. The Aral Sea desiccation accelerated between 2004 and 2008. The area of sandy surfaces and salt soils, which bear the greatest dust and salt storm generation potential increased by more than 36 {\%}. In parts of the Aralkum desalinization of soils was found to take place within 4-8 years. The implication of the ongoing regression of the Aral Sea is that the expansion of saline surfaces will continue. Knowing the spatio-temporal dynamics of both the location and the surface characteristics of the source areas for dust and salt storms allows drawing conclusions about the potential hazard degree of the dust load. The remote-sensing-based land cover assessment presented in this study could be coupled with existing knowledge on the location of source areas for an early estimation of trends in shifting dust composition. Opportunities, limits, and requirements of satellite-based land cover classification and change detection in the Aralkum are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The Plio-Quaternary aquifer of Chtouka is located in Southwestern of Morocco. The intensive agricultural activity in Chtouka basin requires the mobilization of 94{\%} of fresh water resources for irrigation. This overexploitation, along with the succession of drought years, sea water intrusion and various sources of pollution, affected the quality and availability of groundwater resources. Several sampling campaigns were carried out in different sites of the study area in order to investigate the spatial variation of groundwater quality. The temporal evolution of groundwater level shows that the water table was subjected to a gradual decline during the last decade, indicating an intensive exploitation mainly in irrigated areas. In the Southern part around Belfaa and the irrigated area along Massa River, nitrate concentrations exceed 50 mg/L, which is the threshold set by the World Health Organization, while in the northern part around Biougra and Ait Amira, the nitrate concentration is mostly below 50 mg/L indicating a relative good groundwater quality. This finding can be explained by the improvement of agricultural practices, particularly the conversion of flood and sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation (80{\%} of the total irrigated area) in most of the developed farms in this part of the study area. Moreover, the exploitation of groundwater from the deep aquifer, due to the increasing water demand in the region, can also explain the low chemical concentrations since the deep aquifer is not affected by anthropogenic pollutants or marine intrusion. Stable isotopes ( 18 O and 2 H) highlight the different origins of groundwater, indicating the complexity of the aquifer system path flows, which is attributable to the intensive exploitation and irrigation water return.},

abstract = {Improved and up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC) data sets that classify specific crop types and associated land use practices are needed over intensively cropped regions such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, to support science and policy applications focused on understanding the role and response of the agricultural sector to environmental change issues. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) holds considerable promise for detailed, large-area crop-related LULC mapping in this region given its global coverage, unique combination of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, and the cost-free status of its data. The objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability of time-series MODIS 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for large-area crop-related LULC mapping over the U.S. Central Great Plains. A hierarchical crop mapping protocol, which applied a decision tree classifier to multi-temporal NDVI data collected over the growing season, was tested for the state of Kansas. The hierarchical classification approach produced a series of four crop-related LULC maps that progressively classified: 1) crop/non-crop, 2) general crop types (alfalfa, summer crops, winter wheat, and fallow), 3) specific summer crop types (corn, sorghum, and soybeans), and 4) irrigated/non-irrigated crops. A series of quantitative and qualitative assessments were made at the state and sub-state levels to evaluate the overall map quality and highlight areas of misclassification for each map. The series of MODIS NDVI-derived crop maps generally had classification accuracies greater than 80{\%}. Overall accuracies ranged from 94{\%} for the general crop map to 84{\%} for the summer crop map. The state-level crop patterns classified in the maps were consistent with the general cropping patterns across Kansas. The classified crop areas were usually within 1-5{\%} of the USDA reported crop area for most classes. Sub-state comparisons found the areal discrepancies for most classes to be relatively minor throughout the state. In eastern Kansas, some small cropland areas could not be resolved at MODIS' 250 m resolution and led to an underclassification of cropland in the crop/non-crop map, which was propagated to the subsequent crop classifications. Notable regional areal differences in crop area were also found for a few selected crop classes and locations that were related to climate factors (i.e., omission of marginal, dryland cropped areas and the underclassification of irrigated crops in western Kansas), localized precipitation patterns (overclassification of irrigated crops in northeast Kansas), and specific cropping practices (double cropping in southeast Kansas). {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This situation hampers the development of a sound understanding of the mechanisms, determinants, and constraints underlying changes in land-use intensity. On the basis of a review of approaches for studying land-use intensity, we propose a conceptual framework to quantify and analyse land-use intensity. This framework integrates three dimensions: (a) input intensity, (b) output intensity, and (c) the associated system-level impacts of land-based production (e.g. changes in carbon storage or biodiversity). The systematic development of indicators across these dimensions would provide opportunities for the systematic analyses of the trade-offs, synergies and opportunity costs of land-use intensification strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Human-induced land use/cover change has been considered to be one of the most important parts of global environmental changes. In loess hilly and gully regions, to prevent soil loss and achieve better ecological environments, soil conservation measures have been taken during the past decades. The main objective of this study is to quantify the spatio-temporal variability of land use/cover change spatial patterns and make preliminary estimation of the role of human activity in the environmental change in Xihe watershed, Gansu Province, China. To achieve this objective, the methodology was developed in two different aspects, that is, (1) analysis of change patterns by binary image of change trajectories overlaid with different natural geographic factors, in which Relative Change Intensity (RCI) metric was established and used to make comparisons, and (2) analysis based on pattern metrics of main trajectories in the study area. Multi-source and multi-temporal Remote Sensing (RS) images (including Landsat ETM+ (30 June 2001), SPOT imagery (21 November 2003 and 5 May 2008) and CBERS02 CCD (5 June 2006)) were used due to the constraints of the availability of remotely sensed data. First, they were used to extract land use/cover types of each time node by object-oriented classification method. Classification results were then utilized in the trajectory analysis of land use/cover changes through the given four time nodes. Trajectories at every pixel were acquired to trace the history of land use/cover change for every location in the study area. Landscape metrics of trajectories were then analyzed to detect the change characteristics in time and space through the given time series. Analysis showed that most land use/cover changes were caused by human activities, most of which, under the direction of local government, had mainly led to virtuous change on the ecological environments. While, on the contrary, about one quarter of humaninduced changes were vicious ones. Analysis through overlaying binary image of change trajectories with natural factors can efficiently show the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of land use/cover change patterns. It is found that in the study area RCI of land use/cover changes is related to the distance to the river line. And there is a certain correlation between RCI and slope grades. However, no obvious correlation exists between RCI and aspect grades. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated current cotton growing patterns in Khorezm, one representative cotton production region in Uzbekistan utilizing time series of 250-m MODIS satellite data. A Random Forest model was established using reference data of 2004-2007 to generate annual crop maps in 2000-2009. A linear model was applied to assess the spatial distribution of the longest observed cotton sequence within the ten-year observation period. All cotton-growing sequences were compared to the national crop rotation recommendations. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82{\%}. We found that cotton remains the major crop in the region. It was cultivated for more than five out of the ten years on 46.5{\%} of the cropland. But "Soviet cropping conditions" on less than 20{\%} and officially recommended cotton sequences on more than 50{\%} of the cropland challenge the notion that cotton mono-crop dominates Central Asia. Statistical analysis revealed that long cotton sequences preferably occur on fields far from settlements and under reduced soil suitability for irrigation. The results enable decision makers to better explain unfavourable cotton cultivation practices and to stimulate improvements.},

abstract = {Climate change scenarios predict that Central Asia may experience an increase in the frequency and magnitude of temperature and precipitation extremes by the end of the 21st century, but the response regularity of different types of vegetation to climate extremes is uncertain. Based on remote-sensed vegetation index and in-situ meteorological data for the period of 2000–2012, we examined the diverse responses of vegetation to climate mean/extremes and differentiated climatic and anthropogenic influence on the vegetation in Central Asia. Our results showed that extensive vegetation degradation was related to summer water deficit as a result of the combined effect of decreased precipitation and increased potential evapotranspiration. Water was a primary climatic driver for vegetation changes regionally, and human-induced changes in vegetation confined mainly to local areas. Responses of vegetation to water stress varied in different vegetation types. Grasslands were most responsive to water deficit followed by forests and desert vegetation. Climate extremes caused significant vegetation changes, and different vegetation types had diverse responses to climate extremes. Grasslands represented a symmetric response to wet and dry periods. Desert vegetation was more responsive during wet years than in dry years. Forests responded more strongly to dry than to wet years due to a severe drought occurred in 2008. This study has important implications for predicting how vegetation ecosystems in drylands respond to climate mean/extremes under future scenarios of climate change.},

Over the past 10 millennia, it has repeatedly filled and dried, owing both to natural and human forces. The most recent desiccation started in the early 1960s and owes overwhelmingly to the expansion of irrigation that has drained its two tributary rivers. Lake level has fallen 23 m, area shrunk 74{\%}, volume decreased 90{\%}, and salinity grew from 10 to more than 100g/l, causing negative ecological changes, including decimation of native fish species, initiation of dust/salt storms, degradation of deltaic biotic communities, and climate change around the former shoreline. The population residing around the lake has also been negatively impacted. There is little hope in the foreseeable future to fully restore the Aral Sea, but measures to preserve/rehabilitate parts of the water body and the deltas are feasible.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. With the ever-increasing number of satellites and the availability of data free of charge, the integration of multi-sensor images in coherent time series offers new opportunities for land cover and crop type classification. This article investigates the potential of structural biophysical variables as common parameters to consistently combine multi-sensor time series and to exploit them for land/crop cover classification. Artificial neural networks were trained based on a radiative transfer model in order to retrieve high resolution LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER from Landsat-8 and SPOT-4. The correlation coefficients between field measurements and the retrieved biophysical variables were 0.83, 0.85 and 0.79 for LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER, respectively. The retrieved biophysical variables' time series displayed consistent average temporal trajectories, even though the class variability and signal-to-noise ratio increased compared to NDVI. Six random forest classifiers were trained and applied along the season with different inputs: spectral bands, NDVI, as well as FAPAR, LAI and FCOVER, separately and jointly. Classifications with structural biophysical variables reached end-of-season overall accuracies ranging from 73{\%}-76{\%} when used alone and 77{\%} when used jointly. This corresponds to 90{\%} and 95{\%} of the accuracy level achieved with the spectral bands and NDVI. FCOVER appears to be the most promising biophysical variable for classification. When assuming that the cropland extent is known, crop type classification reaches 89{\%} with spectral information, 87{\%} with the NDVI and 81{\%}-84{\%} with biophysical variables.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the long-term trends and variations of temperature and precipitation on annual timescale in the Ili-Balkhash Basin (IBB), Kazakhstan. Some statistical tools were employed to detect any climate variations at four stations in the IBB during the period between 1936 and 2005. These methods included the Mann-Kendall trend test, the Theil-Sen approach, and the sequential Mann-Kendall test. The results showed that in temporal scale, the climate in the IBB has been becoming warmer and wetter in the past several decades as a whole. The annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation in the IBB showed an increasing trend since the 1970s and the 1940s, respectively. The significance of the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation trends in the IBB was tested at {\textgreater}95 {\%} confidence level. The slope of the increasing trend of annual mean temperature ranges from 0.019 to 0.029 °C/year, and that of the annual precipitation ranges from 0.654 to 2.179 mm/year. In spatial scale, the multiyear mean values of temperature and precipitation are greater in the southern mountain region than those in the northern plain and hilly land area of the basin. The multiyear mean temperature decreases with the increasing latitudes, while increases with the increasing altitudes except for Karaganda; the multiyear mean precipitation increase with the increasing altitudes, while decreases centered with the Lake Balkhash from the surrounding area. The results may provide climatic backgrounds for solving the problems related to water sources of the IBB. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Agricultural systems are geographically extensive, have profound significance to society, and affect regional energy, climate, and water cycles. Since most suitable lands worldwide have been cultivated, there is a growing pressure to increase yields on existing agricultural lands. In tropical and subtropical regions, multicropping is widely used to increase food production, but regional-to-global information related to multicropping practices is poor. The high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution of the MODIS sensors provide an ideal source of information for characterizing cropping practices over large areas. Relative to studies that document agricultural extensification, however, systematic assessment of agricultural intensification via multicropping has received relatively little attention. The goal of this work was to help close this information gap by developing methods that use multitemporal remote sensing to map multicropping systems in Asia. Image time-series analysis is especially challenging in this part of the world because atmospheric conditions including clouds and aerosols lead to high frequencies of missing or low-quality observations, especially during the Asian Monsoon. The methodology that we developed builds upon the algorithm used to produce the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics product (MCD12Q2), but uses an improved methodology optimized for crops. We assessed our results at the aggregate scale using state, district, and provincial level inventory statistics reporting total cropped and harvested areas, and at the field scale using survey results for 191 field sites in Bangladesh. While the algorithm highlighted the dominant continental-scale patterns in agricultural practices throughout Asia, and produced reasonable estimates of state and provincial level total harvested areas, field-scale assessment revealed significant challenges in mapping high cropping intensity due to abundant missing data.},

SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS The reliability of clinicians' ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis and the interpretation of examination findings. Often, these ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal scale. For such data, the kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability. Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence, bias, and non-independent ratings) are discussed, and ways of evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered. The issue of statistical testing of kappa is considered, including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated. CONCLUSIONS The article concludes with recommendations for the use and interpretation of kappa.},

abstract = {The decrease of river runoff draining into Lake Balkhash in Central Asia was investigated using hydrological and meteorological data over a long-term period. The data from the difference integral curves of the annual runoff from 1911 to 1986 suggested that a low-flow period began in 1970 in the River Ili, and in 1973 in the east rivers, continuing until 1986. Compared with the runoff before 1969, the decrease of runoff in the upper reaches of the River Ili was less than those in the middle and lower reaches. The decrease in the upper reaches resulted from natural variability, whereas those of the middle and lower reaches were due to a combination of the effects of climate and human activity. There are two reasons for this. First, after 1970, precipitation did not decrease uniformly across the entire basin. Second, in 1970, the Kapchagay dam started operating. As a result, the annual inflow into Lake Balkhash from the River Ili after 1970 decreased to 77{\%} of the pre-1969 mean. Similarly, after 1973, the inflow from the east rivers was 75{\%} of the pre-1972 mean. The characteristics of the runoff in the growing season (April to September) and those in the non-growing season (October to March) were investigated for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the River Ili. In all reaches, the runoff in the non-growing season remained unchanged both before and after 1969. However, from 1970 to 1986, decreases of river flow in the growing season were 2{\textperiodcentered}0 to 2{\textperiodcentered}5 times greater in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches. This was primarily due to the impacts of human activity. In conclusion, it can be deduced that the decrease in runoff after 1970 in the middle and lower reaches was the result of human activity during the low-flow period.},

abstract = {Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data. Various ensemble classification methods have been proposed in recent years. These methods have been proven to improve classification accuracy considerably. The most widely used ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known ensemble methods on multisource remote sensing and geographic data. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data forms the basis for numerous land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and analysis frameworks at regional scale. Compared to other satellite sensors, the spatial, temporal and spectral specifications of MODIS are considered as highly suitable for LULC classifications which support many different aspects of social, environmental and developmental research. The LULC mapping of this study was carried out in the context of the development of an evaluation approach for Zimbabwe's land reform program. Within the discourse about the success of this program, a lack of spatially explicit methods to produce objective data, such as on the extent of agricultural area, is apparent. We therefore assessed the suitability of moderate spatial and high temporal resolution imagery and phenological parameters to retrieve regional figures about the extent of cropland area in former freehold tenure in a series of 13 years from 2001–2013. Time-series data was processed with TIMESAT and was stratified according to agro-ecological potential zoning of Zimbabwe. Random Forest (RF) classifications were used to produce annual binary crop/non crop maps which were evaluated with high spatial resolution data from other satellite sensors. We assessed the cropland products in former freehold tenure in terms of classification accuracy, inter-annual comparability and heterogeneity. Although general LULC patterns were depicted in classification results and an overall accuracy of over 80{\%} was achieved, user accuracies for rainfed agriculture were limited to below 65{\%}. We conclude that phenological analysis has to be treated with caution when rainfed agriculture and grassland in semi-humid tropical regions have to be separated based on MODIS spectral data and phenological parameters. Because classification results significantly underestimate redistributed commercial farmland in Zimbabwe, we argue that the method cannot be used to produce spatial information on land-use which could be linked to tenure change. Hence capabilities of moderate resolution data are limited to assess Zimbabwe's land reform. To make use of the unquestionable potential of MODIS time-series analysis, we propose an analysis of plant productivity which allows to link annual growth and production of vegetation to ownership after Zimbabwe's land reform.},

abstract = {Farmland abandonment is a widespread land-use change in temperate regions, due to increasing yields on productive lands, conservation policies, and the increasing imports of agricultural products from other regions. Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1{\%} (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9{\%}), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4{\%} of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1. Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6. Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 11.2. Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.},

abstract = {In many regions worldwide, cropland abandonment is growing, which has strong and known environmental and socio-economic consequences. Yet, spatially explicit information on the spatial pattern of abandonment is sparse, particularly in post-Soviet countries of Central Asia. When thriving reaching for key Millennium Development Goals such as food security and poverty reduction, the issue of cropland abandonment is critical and therefore must be monitored and limited, or land use transformed into an alternative one. Central Asia experienced large changes of its agricultural system after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Land degradation, which started already before independence, and cropland abandonment is growing in extent, but their spatial pattern remains ill-understood. The objective of this study was to map and analyse agricultural land use in the irrigated areas of Kyzyl-Orda, southern Kazakhstan, Central Asia. For mapping land use and identifying abandoned agricultural land, an object-based classification approach was applied. Random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) algorithms permitted classifying Landsat and RapidEye data from 2009 to 2014. Overlaying these maps with information about irrigated land parcels, installed during the Soviet period, allowed indicating abandoned fields. Fusing the results of the two approaches, RF and SVM, resulted in classification accuracies of up to 97{\%}. This was statistically significantly higher than with RF or SVM alone. Through the analysis of the land use trajectories, abandoned agricultural fields and a clear indication of abandoned land were identified on almost 50{\%} of all fields in Kyzyl-Orda with an accuracy of approximately 80{\%}. The outputs of this study may provide valuable information for planners, policy- and decision-makers to support better-informed decision-making like reducing possible environmental impacts of land abandonment, or identifying areas for sustainable intensification or re-cultivation.},

abstract = {The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity and affects climate, biological diversity and human wellbeing. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions, statistical extrapolation of regional data and satellite imagery, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal. Losses in Australia and the USA linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

This study revealed the characteristics of climate change and abrupt change points of precipitation and temperature during different time scales in the Ili River Basin within the past 50 years. The results showed that the precipitation increased from the mid-1980s until 2000 and has continued to increase at a smaller magnitude since 2000. Over the studied period, the precipitation increased significantly during the summer and winter months. The temperature increased greatly in the late 1980s, and has continued to show an increasing trend from the year 2000 to present. The temperature increases were most significant during the summer, autumn and winter months. In terms of different geographies, the temperature increase was significant during the winter in the plains and hilly regions; the increase was also significant during autumn in the intermontane basins. The climate change trends in the Ili River Basin were consistent with the changing trends of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the plateau monsoon. {\textcopyright} 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {This paper addressed problems on the history of the formation and functioning in one of the largest intracontinental estuary in Kazakhstan-the Ili River waterway. Being a natural regulator of the ecological status of the region, Ili River estuary also influences the water regime of Lake Balkash. This paper studied the current state of hydrographic and hydrological networks in a selected area and the distribution of water flow entering the estuary on various ducts. Using a water balance method, in this study, calculated loss of water in the delta also estimated runoff to the peak of delta and the inflow of river water into Lake Balkash for two periods: the natural and disturbed conditions. As a result of work performed, it was possible to trace dynamics of hydraulic parameters for a multiyear period. {\textcopyright} 2012 Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract = {Eastern Europe and Central Asia is a major food producer and exporter. Almost a quarter of world wheat exports come from the region, and especially from Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine (RUK). The potential of these countries to become a “bread basket” for the world has been emphasized because of already large production and exports and their “immense land and yield reserves”, referring to the abandonment of more than 50 million hectares of cropland and the large drop in crop productivity in the 1990s. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the potential of this land for food production. In this paper we review interdisciplinary literature and empirical evidence, predictions of production potential and impacts of climate change; and discuss the potential of the region to become a reliable breadbasket of the world. From a biophysical (crop growth) perspective, under different scenarios of increased yields, land use and climate change effects, RUK could produce an additional 40–110 million tons of wheat compared to current production, which would be a substantial additional production. However economic incentives, in particular the evolution of food prices and competition from other crops, are likely to significantly constrain these potentials. In addition, the introduction of export restrictions during recent times of high prices raised concerns on the reliability of RUK as exporters.},

abstract = {Crop mapping is one major component of agricultural resource monitoring using remote sensing. Yield or water demand modeling requires that both, the total surface that is cultivated and the accurate distribution of crops, respectively is known. Map quality is crucial and influences the model outputs. Although the use of multi-spectral time series data in crop mapping has been acknowledged, the potentially high dimensionality of the input data remains an issue. In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3{\%}, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection. Uncertainty measures from SVM are an informative source of information on the spatial distribution of error in the crop maps. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Cropland abandonment is globally widespread and has strong repercussions for regional food security and the environment. Statistics suggest that one of the hotspots of abandoned cropland is located in the  drylands of the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), which covers parts of post-Soviet Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran. To date, the exact spatial and temporal extents of abandoned cropland remain unclear, which hampers land-use planning. Abandoned land is a potentially valuable resource for alternative land uses. Here, we mapped the abandoned cropland in the drylands of the ASB with a time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2003-2016. To overcome the restricted ability of a single classifier to accurately map land-use classes across large areas and agro-environmental gradients, "stratum-specific" classifiers were calibrated and classification results were fused based on a locally weighted decision fusion approach. Next, the agro-ecological suitability of abandoned cropland areas was evaluated. The stratum-specific classification approach yielded an overall accuracy of 0.879, which was significantly more accurate (p  {\textless}  0.05) than a "global" classification without stratification, which had an accuracy of 0.811. In 2016, the classification results showed that 13{\%} (1.15 Mha) of the observed irrigated cropland in the ASB was idle (abandoned). Cropland abandonment occurred mostly in the Amudarya and Syrdarya downstream regions and was associated with degraded land and areas prone to water stress. Despite the almost twofold population growth and increasing food demand in the ASB area from 1990 to 2016, abandoned cropland was also located in areas with high suitability for farming. The map of abandoned cropland areas provides a novel basis for assessing the causes leading to abandoned cropland in the ASB. This contributes to assessing the suitability of abandoned cropland for food or bioenergy production, carbon storage, or assessing the environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.},

abstract = {We have reviewed about 100 studies on past changes in climate, snow cover, glaciers and runoff in Central Asian headwater catchments, which have been published in the past 20. years. We included studies published by Central Asian researchers in Russian language, which are usually not easily accessible to international researchers. Most studies agreed on general warming trends in Central Asia with acceleration since the 1970s, but varied with regard to seasonal changes and the magnitude of the warming. Most studies also confirmed that glaciers in the Tien Shan and the Pamir continue to retreat and to shrink, though only little is known about mass and volume changes. Only few studies investigated changes in seasonal snow cover, and they suggested a decrease in maximum snow depth and a reduction in snow cover duration. The studies on runoff trends in the high mountain areas of Central Asia indicated a complex response of catchments to changes in climate. It appears that catchments with a higher fraction of glacierized area showed mainly increasing runoff trends in the past, while river basins with less or no glacierization exhibited large variations in the observed runoff changes.We conclude that our knowledge is still incomplete in particular with regard to the magnitude and the spatio-temporal patterns of changes in the water cycle of Central Asian headwater catchments. The limitations in our knowledge are due to (1) the scarcity of reliable and appropriate data sets especially for the glacio-nival zone; (2) methodological limitations of trend analysis; (3) the heterogeneity in both spatial and temporal extent of the available analyses, hampering the synthesis to a regional picture; and (4) the insufficiently understood interactions between changes in highly-variable climate parameters, the cryosphere, and the hydrological response of individual headwater catchments.Finally, there is a need for sound attribution studies linking the observed hydrological changes in individual catchments to particular processes triggered by climatic and cryospheric changes. This research gap needs urgently to be closed as projections of future hydrological changes are of vital importance for water management in Central Asia. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

abstract = {Information of crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop productivity and crop management. Therefore we developed a new method for remotely determining phenological stages of paddy rice. The method consists of three procedures: (i) prescription of multi-temporal MODIS/Terra data; (ii) filtering time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data by time-frequency analysis; and (iii) specifying the phenological stages by detecting the maximum point, minimal point and inflection point from the smoothed EVI time profile. Applying this method to MODIS data, we determined the planting date, heading date, harvesting date, and growing period in 2002. And we validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 30 paddy fields. As for the filtering, we adopted wavelet and Fourier transforms. Three types of mother wavelet (Daubechies, Symlet and Coiflet) were used in Wavelet transform. As the results of validation, the wavelet transform performed better than the Fourier transform. Specifically, the case using Coiflet (order = 4) gave remarkably good results in determining phenological stages and growing periods. The root mean square errors of the estimated phenological dates against the statistical data were: 12.1 days for planting date, 9.0 days for heading date, 10.6 days for harvesting date, and 11.0 days for growing period. The method using wavelet transform with Coiflet (order = 4) allows the determination of regional characteristics of rice phenology. We proposed this new method using the wavelet transform; Wavelet based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Kazakhstan is the second largest country to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Consequent to the abrupt institutional changes surrounding the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Kazakhstan has reportedly undergone extensive land cover/land use change. Were the institutional changes sufficiently great to affect land surface phenology at spatial resolutions and extents relevant to mesoscale meteorological models? To explore this question, we used the NDVI time series (1985-1988 and 1995-1999) from the Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Land (PAL) dataset, which consists of 10 days maximum NDVI composites at a spatial resolution of 8 km. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were extracted from the NCEP Reanalysis Project and 10 days composites of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) were produced. We selected for intensive study seven agricultural areas ranging from regions with rain-fed spring wheat cultivation in the north to regions of irrigated cotton and rice in the south. We applied three distinct but complementary statistical analyses: (1) nonparametric testing of sample distributions; (2) simple time series analysis to evaluate trends and seasonality; and (3) simple regression models describing NDVI as a quadratic function of AGDD. The irrigated areas displayed different temporal developments of NDVI between 1985-1988 and 1995-1999. As the temperature regime between the two periods was not significantly different, we conclude that observed differences in the temporal development of NDVI resulted from changes in agricultural practices. In the north, the temperature regime was also comparable for both periods. Based on extant socioeconomic studies and our model analyses, we conclude that the changes in the observed land surface phenology in the northern regions are caused by large increases in fallow land dominated by weedy species and by grasslands under reduced grazing pressure. Using multiple lines of evidence allowed us to build a case of whether differences in land surface phenology were mostly the result of anthropogenic influences or interannual climatic fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. Global agricultural production will likely need to increase in the future due to population growth, changing diets, and the rising importance of bioenergy. Intensifying already existing cropland is often considered more sustainable than converting more natural areas. Unfortunately, our understanding of cropping patterns and intensity is weak, especially at broad geographic scales. We characterized and mapped cropping systems in Europe, a region containing diverse cropping systems, using four indicators: (a) cropping frequency (number of cropped years), (b) multi-cropping (number of harvests per year), (c) fallow cycles, and (d) crop duration ratio (actual time under crops) based on the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from 2000 to 2012. Second, we used these cropping indicators and self-organizing maps to identify typical cropping systems. The resulting six clusters correspond well with other indicators of agricultural intensity (e.g., nitrogen input, yields) and reveal substantial differences in cropping intensity across Europe. Cropping intensity was highest in Germany, Poland, and the eastern European Black Earth regions, characterized by high cropping frequency, multi-cropping and a high crop duration ratio. Contrarily, we found lowest cropping intensity in eastern Europe outside the Black Earth region, characterized by longer fallow cycles. Our approach highlights how satellite image time series can help to characterize spatial patterns in cropping intensity - information that is rarely surveyed on the ground and commonly not included in agricultural statistics: our clustering approach also shows a way forward to reduce complexity when measuring multiple indicators. The four cropping indicators we used could become part of continental-scale agricultural monitoring in order to identify target regions for sustainable intensification, where trade-offs between intensification and the environmental should be explored.},

Threats are reduced runoff of the Ile River due to increasing water consumption upstream, overfishing, fires ignited by local people, logging for fuel wood collection, over-grazing, and water pollution from upstream. Major research gaps to be addressed are: 1) impact of reduced discharges of the Ile River on the wetland ecosystems and associated changes in livestock grazing, 2) impact of reduced discharges on spawning grounds for fish, 3) upper harvest limits for the fishery, and 4) regrowth of riparian woodlands.},

The river has been extensively impounded and diverted over the past half century to produce hydroelectric power and food on irrigated land. Water withdrawals are increasing to the extent that they are beginning to threaten the ecosystem, just as it is becoming stressed by altered inflows as glaciers retreat and disappear. If the Ili River ecosystem is to be preserved, it is crucial that we thoroughly understand the spatial and temporal nuances of the interrelationships between water, energy, and foodand the vulnerability of these components to climate change. The ecosystem has all of the characteristics of a classically-defined wicked problem, and so it warrants treatment as a complex and dynamic challenge subject to changing assumptions, unexpected consequences, and strong social and economic overtones. Research should thus focus not just on new knowledge about the water, energy, or food component, but on advancing our understanding of the ecosystem as a whole.

The most recent oscillation was accompanied by construction of a water storage reservoir on the Ili River, the main inflow to the lake, leading to an additional decrease in the Balkhash Lake water level, and to dehydration of wetland landscapes in the Ili River delta. The main purpose of this study was to model the link between wetland biomass conditions in the Ili River delta and changes in the Balkhash Lake water level. A monthly, coarse-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset was used as an indicator of vegetation activity and biomass dynamics in the Ili River delta wetland for the period between 1982 and 2003. The NDVI displays significant intra-annual and interannual variability strongly correlated with Ili River discharge and Balkhash Lake water level.

Over the studied period, the precipitation increased significantly during the summer and winter months. The temperature increased greatly in the late 1980s, and has continued to show an increasing trend from the year 2000 to present. The temperature increases were most significant during the summer, autumn and winter months. In terms of different geographies, the temperature increase was significant during the winter in the plains and hilly regions; the increase was also significant during autumn in the intermontane basins.

We used independently derived NDVI from atmospherically corrected ETM+ data at 13 Earth Observation System Land Validation core sites, eight locations of drought, and globally aggregated one-degree data from the four coarse resolution sensors to assess the NDVI records agreement. The objectives of this paper are to: 1) compare the absolute and relative differences of the vegetation signal across these sensors from a user perspective, and, to a lesser degree, 2) evaluate the possibility of merging the AVHRR historical data record with that of the more modern sensors in order to pro­ vide historical perspective on current vegetation activities. The statistical and correlation analyses demonstrate that due to the similarity in their overall variance, it is not necessary to choose between the longer time series of AVHRR and the higher quality of the more modern sensors. The long-term AVHRR-NDVI record provides a critical historical perspective on vegetation activities necessary for global change research and, thus, should be the basis of an intercalibrated, sensor-independent NDVI data record. This paper suggests that continuity is achievable given the similarity between these datasets.},

abstract = {During the Soviet Virgin Lands Campaign, approximately 23 million hectares (Mha) of Eurasian steppe grassland were converted into cropland in Northern Kazakhstan from 1954 to 1963. As a result Kazakhstan became an important breadbasket of the former Soviet Union. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered widespread agricultural abandonment, and much cropland reverted to grasslands. Our goal in this study was to reconstruct and analyze agricultural land-cover change since the eve of the Virgin Lands Campaign, from 1953 to 2010 in Kostanay Province, a region that is representative of Northern Kazakhstan. Further, we assessed the potential of currently idle cropland for re-cultivation. We reconstructed the cropland extent before and after the Virgin Lands Campaign using archival maps, and we mapped the agricultural land cover in the late Soviet and post-Soviet period using multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ images from circa 1990, 2000 and 2010. Cropland extent peaked at approximately 3.1 Mha in our study area in 1990, 38{\%} of which had been converted from grasslands from 1954 to 1961. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 45{\%} of the Soviet cropland was abandoned and had reverted to grassland by 2000. After 2000, cropland contraction and re-cultivation were balanced. Using spatial logistic regressions we found that cropland expansion during the Virgin Lands Campaign was significantly associated with favorable agro-environmental conditions. In contrast, cropland expansion after the Campaign until 1990, as well as cropland contraction after 1990, occurred mainly in areas that were less favorable for agriculture. Cropland re-cultivation after 2000 was occurring on lands with relatively favorable agro-environmental conditions in comparison to remaining idle croplands, albeit with much lower agro-environmental endowment compared to stable croplands from 1990 to 2010. In sum, we found that cropland production potentials of the currently uncultivated areas are much lower than commonly believed, and further cropland expansion is only possible at the expense of marginal lands. Our results suggest if increasing production is a goal, improving crop yields in currently cultivated lands should be a focus, whereas extensive livestock grazing as well as the conservation of non-provisioning ecosystem services and biodiversity should be priority on more marginal lands.},

abstract = {This study is aimed at a better understanding of how upstream runoff formation affected the cropping intensity (CI: number of harvests) in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) between 2000 and 2012. MODIS 250 m NDVI time series and knowledge-based pixel masking that included settlement layers and topography features enabled to map the irrigated cropland extent (iCE). Random forest models supported the classification of cropland vegetation phenology (CVP: winter/summer crops, double cropping, etc.). CI and the percentage of fallow cropland (PF) were derived from CVP. Spearman's rho was selected for assessing the statistical relation of CI and PF to runoff formation in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya catchments per hydrological year. Validation in 12 reference sites using multi-annual Landsat-7 ETM+ images revealed an average overall accuracy of 0.85 for the iCE maps. MODIS maps overestimated that based on Landsat by an average factor of {\~{}}1.15 (MODIS iCE/Landsat iCE). Exceptional overestimations occurred in case of inaccurate settlement layers. The CVP and CI maps achieved overall accuracies of 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. The Amu Darya catchment disclosed significant positive (negative) relations between upstream runoff with CI (PF) and a high pressure on the river water resources in 2000–2012. Along the Syr Darya, reduced dependencies could be observed, which is potentially linked to the high number of water constructions in that catchment. Intensified double cropping after drought years occurred in Uzbekistan. However, a 10 km × 10 km grid of Spearman's rho (CI and PF vs. upstream runoff) emphasized locations at different CI levels that are directly affected by runoff fluctuations in both river systems. The resulting maps may thus be supportive on the way to achieve long-term sustainability of crop production and to simultaneously protect the severely threatened environment in the ASB. The gained knowledge can be further used for investigating climatic impacts of irrigation in the region.},

abstract = {Information about the Earth's surface is required in many wide-scale applications. Land cover/use classification using remotely sensed images is one of the most common applications in remote sensing, and many algorithms have been developed and applied for this purpose in the literature. Support vector machines (SVMs) are a group of supervised classification algorithms that have been recently used in the remote sensing field. The classification accuracy produced by SVMs may show variation depending on the choice of the kernel function and its parameters. In this study, SVMs were used for land cover classification of Gebze district of Turkey using Landsat ETM+ and Terra ASTER images. Polynomial and radial basis kernel functions with their estimated optimum parameters were applied for the classification of the data sets and the results were analyzed thoroughly. Results showed that SVMs, especially with the use of radial basis function kernel, outperform the maximum likelihood classifier in terms of overall and individual class accuracies. Some important findings were also obtained concerning the changes in land use/cover in the study area. This study verifies the effectiveness and robustness of SVMs in the classification of remotely sensed images. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Support vector machine (SVM) was applied for land-cover characterization using MODIS time-series data. Classification performance was examined with respect to training sample size, sample variability, and landscape homogeneity (purity). The results were compared to two conventional nonparametric image classification algorithms: multilayer perceptron neural networks (NN) and classification and regression trees (CART). For 2001 MODIS time-series data, SVM generated overall accuracies ranging from 77{\%} to 80{\%} for training sample sizes from 20 to 800 pixels per class, compared to 67-76{\%} and 62-73{\%} for NN and CART, respectively. These results indicated that SVM's had superior generalization capability, particularly with respect to small training sample sizes. There was also less variability of SVM performance when classification trials were repeated using different training sets. Additionally, classification accuracies were directly related to sample homogeneity/heterogeneity. The overall accuracies for the SVM algorithm were 91{\%} (Kappa = 0.77) and 64{\%} (Kappa = 0.34) for homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels, respectively. The inclusion of heterogeneous pixels in the training sample did not increase overall accuracies. Also, the SVM performance was examined for the classification of multiple year MODIS time-series data at annual intervals. Finally, using only the SVM output values, a method was developed to directly classify pixel purity. Approximately 65{\%} of pixels within the Albemarle-Pamlico Basin study area were labeled as "functionally homogeneous" with an overall classification accuracy of 91{\%} (Kappa = 0.79). The results indicated a high potential for regional scale operational land-cover characterization applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {People with a mental illness may be subject to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), depending on definitions of terms such as 'impairment', 'long-term' and the capaciousness of the word 'includes' in the Convention's characterisation of persons with disabilities. Particularly challenging under the CRPD is the scope, if any, for involuntary treatment. Conventional mental health legislation, such as the Mental Health Act (England and Wales) appears to violate, for example, Article 4 ('no discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability'), Article 12 (persons shall 'enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life') and Article 14 ('the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty').We argue that a form of mental health law, such as the Fusion Law proposal, is consistent with the principles of the CRPD. Such law is aimed at eliminating discrimination against persons with a mental illness. It covers all persons regardless of whether they have a 'mental' or a 'physical' illness, and only allows involuntary treatment when a person's decision-making capability (DMC) for a specific treatment decision is impaired - whatever the health setting or cause of the impairment - and where supported decision making has failed. In addition to impaired DMC, involuntary treatment would require an assessment that such treatment gives the person's values and perspective paramount importance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. The Ili River is a transboundary river shared by China, upstream, and Kazakhstan, downstream. The Ili is the main water supplier to Lake Balkhash, the largest lake in Central Asia after desiccation of the Aral Sea. Agreements over water allocation have not been concluded between China and Kazakhstan. This paper investigated water consumption of agriculture and riparian ecosystems in the Ili river basin, to provide information for further debate on water allocation, through the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) approach using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. The overall water consumption in the Ili river basin was 14.3 km 3 /a in 2000, 17.2 km 3 /a in 2005, and 15 km 3 /a in 2014. In 2000, China and Kazakhstan consumed 38{\%} and 62{\%} of the water, respectively. By 2014, the relative share of China's water consumption increased to 43{\%}. In China, 80{\%} of the water consumption is due to agriculture. High runoff during the past 10 years enabled increasing water consumption in China and sufficient water supply to agriculture and riparian ecosystems in Kazakhstan. When runoff of the Ili River decreases, as expected for most rivers in Central Asia, then irrigation efficiency has to be further increased in China, and irrigation systems in Kazakhstan have to be restored and modernized in order to reduce water consumption and protect Lake Balkhash and the riparian ecosystems.},

Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. A simple approach was developed to predict corn yields using the MoDerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product from two geographically separate major corn crop production regions: Illinois, USA and Heilongjiang, China. The MOD09A1 data, which are eight-day interval surface reflectance data, were obtained from day of the year (DOY) 89 to 337 to calculate the leaf area index (LAI). The sum of the LAI from early in the sea son to a given date in the season (end of DOY (EOD)) was well fitted to a logistic function and represented seasonal changes in leaf area duration (LAD). A simple phenology model was derived to estimate the dates of emergence and maturity using the LAD-logistic function parameters b1 and b2, which represented the rate of increase in LAI and the date of maximum LAI, respectively. The phenology model predicted emergence and maturity dates fairly well, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 6.3 and 4.9 days for the validation dataset, respectively. Two simple linear regression models (YP and YF) were established using LAD as the variable to predict corn yield. The yield model Y P used LAD from predicted emergence to maturity, and the yield model Y f used LAD for a predetermined period from DOY 89 to a particular EOD. When state/province corn yields for the validation dataset were predicted at DOY 321, near completion of the corn harvest, the Y P model, including the predicted phenology, performed much better than the Y f model, with RMSE values of 0.68 t/ha and 0.66 t/ha for Illinois and Heilongjiang, respectively. The Y p model showed similar or better performance, even for the much earlier pre-harvest yield prediction at DOY 257. In addition, the model performance showed no difference between the two study regions with very different climates and cultivation methods, including cultivar and irrigation management. These results suggested that the approach described in this paper has potential for application to relatively wide agroclimatic regions with different cultivation methods and for extension to the other crops. However, it needs to be examined further in tropical and sub-tropical regions, which are very different from the two study regions with respect to agroclimatic constraints and agrotechnologies.},

abstract = {Farmland abandonment is a widespread land-use change in temperate regions, due to increasing yields on productive lands, conservation policies, and the increasing imports of agricultural products from other regions. Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1{\%} (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9{\%}), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4{\%} of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1. Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6. Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 11.2. Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of regional to global scale vegetation dynamics (phenology) are required to improve models and understanding of inter-annual variability in terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere interactions. Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined thresholds. Preliminary results based on an annual time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the northeastern United States demonstrate that the method is able to monitor vegetation phenology with good success. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology. Novel sensors and methods are entering the market, offering completely new possibilities to carry out remote sensing tasks. Three-dimensional (3D) hyperspectral remote sensing is a novel and powerful technology that has recently become available to small UAVs. This study investigated the performance of UAV-based photogrammetry and hyperspectral imaging in individual tree detection and tree species classification in boreal forests. Eleven test sites with 4151 reference trees representing various tree species and developmental stages were collected in June 2014 using a UAV remote sensing system equipped with a frame format hyperspectral camera and an RGB camera in highly variable weather conditions. Dense point clouds were measured photogrammetrically by automatic image matching using high resolution RGB images with a 5 cm point interval. Spectral features were obtained from the hyperspectral image blocks, the large radiometric variation of which was compensated for by using a novel approach based on radiometric block adjustment with the support of in-flight irradiance observations. Spectral and 3D point cloud features were used in the classification experiment with various classifiers. The best results were obtained with Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which both gave 95{\%} overall accuracies and an F-score of 0.93. Accuracy of individual tree identification from the photogrammetric point clouds varied between 40{\%} and 95{\%}, depending on the characteristics of the area. Challenges in reference measurements might also have reduced these numbers. Results were promising, indicating that hyperspectral 3D remote sensing was operational from a UAV platform even in very difficult conditions. These novel methods are expected to provide a powerful tool for automating various environmental close-range remote sensing tasks in the very near future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Long-term observations of vegetation phenology can be used to monitor the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Satellite remote sensing provides the most efficient means to observe phenological events through time series analysis of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study investigates the potential of a Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), which has been linked to vegetation light use efficiency, to improve the accuracy of MODIS-based estimates of phenology in an evergreen conifer forest. Timings of the start and end of the growing season (SGS and EGS) were derived from a 13-year-long time series of PRI and NDVI based on a MAIAC (multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction) processed MODIS dataset and standard MODIS NDVI product data. The derived dates were validated with phenology estimates from ground-based flux tower measurements of ecosystem productivity. Significant correlations were found between the MAIAC time series and ground-estimated SGS (R2= 0.36-0.8), which is remarkable since previous studies have found it difficult to observe inter-annual phenological variations in evergreen vegetation from satellite data. The considerably noisier NDVI product could not accurately predict SGS, and EGS could not be derived successfully from any of the time series. While the strongest relationship overall was found between SGS derived from the ground data and PRI, MAIAC NDVI exhibited high correlations with SGS more consistently (R2{\textgreater} 0.6 in all cases). The results suggest that PRI can serve as an effective indicator of spring seasonal transitions, however, additional work is necessary to confirm the relationships observed and to further explore the usefulness of MODIS PRI for detecting phenology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Remote-sensing phenology detection can compensate for deficiencies in field observations and has the advantage of capturing the continuous expression of phenology on a large scale. However, there is some variability in the results of remote-sensing phenology detection derived from different vegetation parameters in satellite time-series data. Since the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the leaf area index (LAI) are  the most widely used vegetation parameters for remote-sensing phenology extraction, this paper aims to assess the differences in phenological information extracted from EVI and LAI time series and to explore whether either index performs well for all vegetation types on a large scale. To this end, a GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite Product)-LAI-based phenology product (GLP) was generated using the same algorithm as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-EVI phenology product (MLCD) over China from 2001 to 2012. The two phenology products were compared in China for different vegetation types and evaluated using ground observations. The results show that the ratio of missing data is 8.3{\%} for the GLP, which is less than the 22.8{\%} for the MLCD. The differences between the GLP and the MLCD become stronger as the latitude decreases, which also vary among different vegetation types. The start of the growing season (SOS) of the GLP is earlier than that of the MLCD in most vegetation types, and the end of the growing season (EOS) of the GLP is generally later than that of the MLCD. Based on ground observations, it can be suggested that the GLP performs better than the MLCD in evergreen needleleaved forests and croplands, while the MLCD performs better than the GLP in shrublands and grasslands.},

abstract = {In this study, we automate tree species classification and mapping using field-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN). We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band ‘Red-Green-Blue' pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classification accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classifier is pixel-based rather than object based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points {\textgreater} 5 m above the ground) and the classifier was applied to image pixels that were thus identified as tree crowns. By training a CNN classifier using field data and hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality, across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional layers, a CNN model classified the correct species of 713 individual trees from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging from 0.67–0.95 depending on species. The CNN classification model performance increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral CNN model captures the species composition changes across {\~{}}700 meters (1935 to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to a higher-elevation fir-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought, insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning classifiers to tree species identification from geospatial imagery and field training data.},

We compared PPC-based structural metrics to traditional ground surveys conducted by field personnel in order to assess the capacity of PPC data to contribute to vegetation-reclamation surveys. We found good statistical agreement between key structural vegetation parameters, such as mean and maximum vegetation height, with PPC metrics successfully predicting most height and tree-diameter metrics using multivariate linear regression. However, PPC metrics were not as useful for estimating ground-measured vegetation cover. We believe that part of the issue lies in the mismatch between PPC- and ground-based measurement approaches, including subjective judgement on behalf of ground crews: a topic that requires more investigation. Our work highlights the emerging value of UAV-based PPCs to complement, and in some cases supplement, traditional ground-based sources of measured vegetation structure.},

Nevertheless, most of this work has been devoted to improving accuracy and explanatory power, often at the cost of usability and affordability. We tested a low-cost UAV and a simple workflow to apply four different greenness indices to the monitoring of pine (Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra) post-fire regeneration in a Mediterranean forest. We selected two sites and measured all pines within a pre-selected plot. Winter flights were carried out at each of the sites, at two flight heights (50 and 120 m). Automatically normalized images entered an structure from motion (SfM) based photogrammetric software for restitution, and the obtained point cloud and orthomosaic processed to get a canopy height model and four different greenness indices. The sum of pine diameter at breast height (DBH) was regressed on summary statistics of greenness indices and the canopy height model. Excess green index (ExGI) and green chromatic coordinate (GCC) index outperformed the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) and green red vegetation index (GRVI) in estimating pine DBH, while canopy height slightly improved the models. Flight height did not severely affect model performance. Our results show that low cost UAVs may improve forest monitoring after disturbance, even in those habitats and situations where resource limitation is an issue.},

In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with Red Green Blue (RGB) and multispectral cameras was used to acquire a series of field images at the flowering stage, and the flower number was manually counted as a reference. Images of the rape field were first classified using K-means method based on Commission Internationale de l'{\'{E}}clairage (CIE) L*a*b* space, and the result showed that classified flower coverage area (FCA) possessed a high correlation with the flower number (r2 = 0.89). The relationships between ten commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images and the flower number were investigated, and the VIs of Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI), Red Green Ratio Index (RGRI) and Modified Green Red Vegetation Index (MGRVI) exhibited the highest correlation to the flower number with the absolute correlation coefficient (r) of 0.91. Random forest (RF) model was developed to predict the flower number, and a good performance was achieved with all UAV variables (r2 = 0.93 and RMSEP = 16.18), while the optimal subset regression (OSR) model was further proposed to simplify the RF model, and a better result with r2 = 0.95 and RMSEP = 14.13 was obtained with the variable combination of RGRI, normalized difference spectral index (NDSI (944, 758)) and FCA. Our findings suggest that combining VIs and image classification from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images possesses the potential of estimating flower number in oilseed rape.},

Therefore a database has been set-up in order to provide the indicators based on a weighted average for each CORINE land cover class within an area of interest. The current work aims to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Satellite remote sensing of plant phenology provides an important indicator of climate change. However, start of the growing season (SOS) estimates in Northern Hemisphere boreal forest areas are known to be challenged by the presence of seasonal snow cover and limited seasonality in the greenness signal for evergreen needleleaf forests, which can both bias and impede trend estimates of SOS. The newly developed Plant Phenology Index (PPI) was specifically designed to overcome both problems. Here we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2000-2014) to analyze the ability of PPI for estimating start of season (SOS) in boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in comparison to two other widely applied indices for SOS retrieval: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Satellite-based SOS is evaluated against gross primary production (GPP)-retrieved SOS derived from a network of flux tower observations in boreal areas (a total of 81 site-years analyzed). Spatiotemporal relationships between SOS derived from PPI, EVI and NDVI are furthermore studied for different boreal land cover types and regions. The overall correlation between SOS derived from VIs and ground measurements was rather low, but PPI performed significantly better (r = 0.50, p {\textless} 0.01) than EVI and NDVI which both showed a very poor correlation (r = 0.11, p = 0. 16 and r = 0.08, p = 0.24). PPI, EVI and NDVI overall produce similar trends in SOS for the Northern Hemisphere showing an advance in SOS towards earlier dates (0.28, 0.23 and 0.26 days/year), but a pronounced difference in trend estimates between PPI and EVI/NDVI is observed for different land cover types. Deciduous needleleaf forest is characterized by the largest advance in SOS when considering all indices, yet PPI showed less dramatic changes as compared to EVI/NDVI (0.47 days/year as compared to 0.62 and 0.74). PPI SOS trends were found to be higher for deciduous broadleaf forests and savannas (0.54 and 0.56 days/year). Taken together, the findings of this study suggest improved performance of PPI over NDVI and EVI in retrieval of SOS in boreal regions and precautions must be taken when interpreting spatio-temporal patterns of SOS from the latter two indices.},

abstract = {Forest phenology is a multi-scale phenomenon, arising from processes in leaves and trees, with effects on the ecology of plant communities and landscapes. Because phenology controls carbon and water cycles, which are commonly observed at the ecosystem scale (e.g. eddy flux measurements), it is important to characterize the relation between phenophase transition events at different spatial scales. We use aerial photography recorded from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to observe plant phenology over a large area (5.4 ha) and across diverse communities, with spatial and temporal resolution at the scale of individual tree crowns and their phenophase transition events (10 m spatial resolution, ∼5 day temporal resolution in spring, weekly in autumn). We validate UAV-derived phenophase transition dates through comparison with direct observations of tree phenology, PhenoCam image analysis, and satellite remote sensing. We then examine the biological correlates of spatial variance in phenology using a detailed species inventory and land cover classification. Our results show that species distribution is the dominant factor in spatial variability of ecosystem phenology. We also explore statistical relations governing the scaling of phenology from an organismic scale (10 m) to forested landscapes (1 km) by analyzing UAV photography alongside Landsat and MODIS data. From this analysis we find that spatial standard deviation in transition dates decreases linearly with the logarithm of increasing pixel size. We also find that fine-scale phenology aggregates to a coarser scale as the median and not the mean date in autumn, indicating coarser scale phenology is less sensitive to the tails of the distribution of sub-pixel transitions in the study area. Our study is the first to observe forest phenology in a spatially comprehensive, whole-ecosystem way, yet with fine enough spatial resolution to describe organism-level correlates and scaling phenomena.},

abstract = {Vegetation phenology such as the onset of green-up and senescence is strongly controlled by climate and other environmental factors, and in turn affects the terrestrial carbon balance. Therefore, phenological observation is important as an indicator of global warming and for estimation of the terrestrial carbon balance. Because phenological responses differ from species to species, precise monitoring from the species scale to the global scale is required. In this study, we analyzed images from digital cameras, which have proliferated in recent years, to investigate their utility as remote sensors. We collected daily images taken by digital cameras in national parks across Japan over 8. years in wetland mixed deciduous forest, and evergreen broadleaved forest. Values of red, green, and blue (RGB) channels in each pixel within images were extracted, and a vegetation green excess index (2G-RBi) was calculated to detect phenology. The time series of 2G-RBi showed clear phenological patterns of each vegetation type in each year at the species or community scale. Even physiological damage due to a typhoon was detected. The dates of green-up were estimated easily and objectively from the second derivative of 2G-RBi, and a trend in yearly green-up dates of various types of vegetation was demonstrated. Furthermore, a strong correlation between interannual variations in green-up dates and local spring temperature was found, and the sensitivity of green-up date to temperature was revealed. The results suggest the utility of digital cameras for phenological observations at precise temporal and spatial resolutions, despite a year-to-year drift of color balance of camera as a technical device. As a form of near-surface remote sensing, digital cameras could obtain significant ecological information. Establishing camera networks could help us understand phenological responses at a wide range of scales. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

UAV flights were carried out over a deciduous woodland during the spring season of 2015, from which a temporal series of 5 cm spatial resolution orthophotos was generated. Initial results are presented in this paper. Four trees with different observed Start of Season (SOS) dates were selected to monitor UAV-derived Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC). The chronological order when sudden increases of GCC values occurred matched with the chronological order of observed SOS. Trees with later observed SOS presented GCC values increasing slowly over time, which were associated with development of understory vegetation. It is concluded that UAV imagery has the potential to track leaf phenology at the individual tree level, but further studies are necessary to better understand this new level of information detected from UAVs.},

Plant phenology is a sensitive indicator of the effects of global change on terrestrial ecosystems and controls the timing of key ecosystem functions including photosynthesis and transpiration. Aerial drone imagery and photogrammetric techniques promise to advance the study of phenology by enabling the creation of distortion-free orthomosaics of plant canopies at the landscape scale, but with branch-level image resolution. The main goal of this study is to determine the leaf life cycle events corresponding to phenological metrics derived from automated analyses based on color indices calculated from drone imagery. For an oak-dominated, temperate deciduous forest in the northeastern USA, we find that plant area index (PAI) correlates with a canopy greenness index during spring green-up, and a canopy redness index during autumn senescence. Additionally, greenness and redness metrics are significantly correlated with the timing of budburst and leaf expansion on individual trees in spring. However, we note that the specific color index for individual trees must be carefully chosen if new foliage in spring appears red, rather than green—which we observed for some oak trees. In autumn, both decreasing greenness and increasing redness correlate with leaf senescence. Maximum redness indicates the beginning of leaf fall, and the progression of leaf fall correlates with decreasing redness. We also find that cooler air temperature microclimates near a forest edge bordering a wetland advance the onset of senescence. These results demonstrate the use of drones for characterizing the organismic-level variability of phenology in a forested landscape and advance our understanding of which phenophase transitions correspond to color-based metrics derived from digital image analysis.},

abstract = {Uttara Kannada district has diverse forest types ranging from tropical evergreen to dry deciduous. This study used remote sensing-based NDVI time-series data from 1999 to 2007 to create the phenological curves and maps for every season and each phenological parameter was created using TIMESAT program. It was observed that evergreen forest sites are always followed by deciduous forest sites in all phenological events. The season starts by August and ends by June the following year in evergreen forests. In deciduous forests, the season starts by May and ends by March the following year. Evergreen forests have longer season than deciduous forests. Maximum temperature and rainfall have negative (r = -0.785) and positive (r = 0.502) correlation respectively with start of the season. However, maximum temperature has high positive correlation (r = 0.942) with leaf senescence. This article indicates that more studies on the phenology of natural vegetation will help to understand the responses of plants towards the changes in the climatic condition.},

abstract = {Validation over heterogeneous areas is critical to ensuring the quality of remote sensing products. This paper focuses on the sampling methods used to validate the coarse-resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) product in the Heihe River Basin, where the patterns of spatial variations in and between land cover types vary significantly in the different growth stages of vegetation. A sampling method, called the mean of surface with non-homogeneity (MSN) method, and three other sampling methods are examined with real-world data obtained in 2012. A series of 15-m-resolution fractional vegetation cover reference maps were generated using the regressions of field-measured and satellite data. The sampling methods were tested using the 15-m-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover maps over a complete period of vegetation growth. Two scenes were selected to represent the situations in which sampling locations were sparsely and densely distributed. The results show that the FVCs estimated using the MSN method have errors of approximately less than 0.03 in the two selected scenes. The validation accuracy of the sampling methods varies with variations in the stratified non-homogeneity in the different growing stages of the vegetation. The MSN method, which considers both heterogeneity and autocorrelations between strata, is recommended for use in the determination of samplings prior to the design of an experimental campaign. In addition, the slight scaling bias caused by the non-linear relationship between NDVI and FVC samples is discussed. The positive or negative trend of the biases predicted using a Taylor expansion is found to be consistent with that of the real biases.},

Deep learning, a cutting-edge technology evolved from Artificial Intelligence, was seen to outperform other techniques when it comes to complex problems such as image classification. In this work, we present a novel method to classify forest tree species through high resolution RGB images acquired with a simple consumer grade camera mounted on a UAV platform using Residual Neural Networks. We used UAV RGB images acquired over three years that varied in numerous acquisition parameters such as season, time, illumination and angle to train the neural network. To begin with, we have experimented with limited data towards the identification of two pine species namely red pine and white pine from the rest of the species. We performed two experiments, first with the images from all three acquisition years and the second with images from only one acquisition year. In the first experiment, we obtained 80{\%} classification accuracy when the trained network was tested on a distinct set of images and in the second experiment, we obtained 51{\%} classification accuracy. As a part of this work, a novel dataset of high-resolution labelled tree species is generated that can be used to conduct further studies involving deep neural networks in forestry.},

SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS The reliability of clinicians' ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis and the interpretation of examination findings. Often, these ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal scale. For such data, the kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability. Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence, bias, and non-independent ratings) are discussed, and ways of evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered. The issue of statistical testing of kappa is considered, including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated. CONCLUSIONS The article concludes with recommendations for the use and interpretation of kappa.},

abstract = {In many regions worldwide, cropland abandonment is growing, which has strong and known environmental and socio-economic consequences. Yet, spatially explicit information on the spatial pattern of abandonment is sparse, particularly in post-Soviet countries of Central Asia. When thriving reaching for key Millennium Development Goals such as food security and poverty reduction, the issue of cropland abandonment is critical and therefore must be monitored and limited, or land use transformed into an alternative one. Central Asia experienced large changes of its agricultural system after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Land degradation, which started already before independence, and cropland abandonment is growing in extent, but their spatial pattern remains ill-understood. The objective of this study was to map and analyse agricultural land use in the irrigated areas of Kyzyl-Orda, southern Kazakhstan, Central Asia. For mapping land use and identifying abandoned agricultural land, an object-based classification approach was applied. Random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) algorithms permitted classifying Landsat and RapidEye data from 2009 to 2014. Overlaying these maps with information about irrigated land parcels, installed during the Soviet period, allowed indicating abandoned fields. Fusing the results of the two approaches, RF and SVM, resulted in classification accuracies of up to 97{\%}. This was statistically significantly higher than with RF or SVM alone. Through the analysis of the land use trajectories, abandoned agricultural fields and a clear indication of abandoned land were identified on almost 50{\%} of all fields in Kyzyl-Orda with an accuracy of approximately 80{\%}. The outputs of this study may provide valuable information for planners, policy- and decision-makers to support better-informed decision-making like reducing possible environmental impacts of land abandonment, or identifying areas for sustainable intensification or re-cultivation.},

CDIAC TR051 (1872-1989 in the study area) was compared with GHCN Gridded Precipitation Products (1900-2007, GHCN{\_}GRD) and CRU TS2.1 (1901-2002), the latter two being used in IPCC AR4 for assessing the global annual land precipitation anomalies in the 20th century. From 1901 to 1989, these datasets had no statistically significant differences, and exhibited similar variations. CDIAC TR051 was, therefore, combined with GHCN{\_}GRD for 1925 without any inhomogeneities found in the combined time series. Around Lake Balkhash, negative precipitation anomalies prevailed from 1872 to 1950 with a significant recovery found around 1900. IPCC AR4 indicated that precipitation increased in Central Asia throughout the 20th century, whereas this study clarified that the increasing trend has been presented since 1872 in the study area. Moreover, the integral curve of the precipitation anomalies corresponded well with variation of the water level of Lake Balkhash, i.e., negative precipitation anomalies from 1872 onward resulted in the continuous decrease of the water level until 1950. This coincides with other proxy data such as a sediment core of Lake Balkhash dug up in 2007.},

The most recent oscillation was accompanied by construction of a water storage reservoir on the Ili River, the main inflow to the lake, leading to an additional decrease in the Balkhash Lake water level, and to dehydration of wetland landscapes in the Ili River delta. The main purpose of this study was to model the link between wetland biomass conditions in the Ili River delta and changes in the Balkhash Lake water level. A monthly, coarse-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset was used as an indicator of vegetation activity and biomass dynamics in the Ili River delta wetland for the period between 1982 and 2003. The NDVI displays significant intra-annual and interannual variability strongly correlated with Ili River discharge and Balkhash Lake water level. This study also developed a simple model between NDVI and the two hydrological variables used in monitoring the hydrological regime of Balkhash Lake and its catchment basin. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

The temperature increased greatly in the late 1980s, and has continued to show an increasing trend from the year 2000 to present. The temperature increases were most significant during the summer, autumn and winter months. In terms of different geographies, the temperature increase was significant during the winter in the plains and hilly regions; the increase was also significant during autumn in the intermontane basins.

A Random Forest model was established using reference data of 2004-2007 to generate annual crop maps in 2000-2009. A linear model was applied to assess the spatial distribution of the longest observed cotton sequence within the ten-year observation period. All cotton-growing sequences were compared to the national crop rotation recommendations. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82{\%}. We found that cotton remains the major crop in the region. It was cultivated for more than five out of the ten years on 46.5{\%} of the cropland. But "Soviet cropping conditions" on less than 20{\%} and officially recommended cotton sequences on more than 50{\%} of the cropland challenge the notion that cotton mono-crop dominates Central Asia. Statistical analysis revealed that long cotton sequences preferably occur on fields far from settlements and under reduced soil suitability for irrigation.

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of water depletion in the irrigated land of Khorezm, a region located in Central Asia in the lower floodplains of the Amu Darya River, were mapped and monitored by means of MODIS land products. Land cover and land use were classified by using a recursive partitioning and regression tree with 250 m MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETact) was obtained by applying the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to 1 km daily MODIS data. Elements of the SEBAL based METRIC model (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) were adopted and modified. The upstream–downstream difference in irrigation was reflected by analyzing agricultural land use and amounts of depleted water (ETact) using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The validity of the MODIS albedo and emissivity used for modeling ETact was assessed with data extracted from literature. The r 2 value of 0.6 indicated a moderate but significant association between ETact and class-A-pan evaporation. Deviations of ETact from the 10-day reference evapotranspiration of wheat and cotton were found to be explainable. In Khorezm, seasonal maximum values superior to 1,200 and 1,000 mm ETact were estimated for rice and cotton fields, respectively. Spatio-temporal comparisons of agricultural land use with seasonal ETact disclosed unequal water consumption in Khorezm. Seasonal ETact on agricultural land decreased with increasing distance to the water intake points of the irrigation system (972–712 mm). Free MODIS data provided reliable, exhaustive, and consistent information on water use relevant for decision support in Central Asian water management.},

However during this period, water resources, originating largely from snow and ice melt, have been subject to large-scale engineering interference required by the growing demands for the expansion of irrigated agriculture. Storage and diversion of flow into irrigation systems have affected original fish stocks through change, in river discharges, blockage of migratory pathways by dams and barrages, increase in dissolved salt content and agrochemicals in drainage waters. In order to boost the indigenous fish stocks, which often give poor yields, fishery managers transferred a number of fish species from other parts of Asia within the ex-Soviet Union. In order to improve the food base for such fish, fish food organisms such as mysids, gammarids and molluscs were also transferred. The introductions often increased fish yields only temporarily or interfered with the indigenous stocks. In addition to valuable fish species, unwanted fish were sometimes brought in. Where river basins became interconnected through canals, fish faunas of these basins intermingled through immigration of species. The new fish communities now form a mixture of indigenous and introduced fish, where one can rarely assume that a balanced state has been achieved. The priority of the governments remains the use of water for irrigation and hydropower production, which leaves fishery managers in the unenviable position of adjusting the management to the continuously changing situation, which is often unpredictable. In order to increase fish production present government strategies focus on the rehabilitation of rivers and terminal lakes with the aim of arresting and reversing the process of salinization of waters and of maintaining water level in lakes. This allows fishery managers to develop strategies for optimizing fish yields under more stable conditions. With the new efforts to revitalize the Aral Sea, the large artificial terminal lakes established from drainage and wash waters, will become of minor importance for fisheries, as their salinity will increase beyond the tolerance level of most fish. However, in fresh-water reservoirs and lakes, including those formed from seepage in depressions near irrigation canals, there is considerable potential for raising fish yields. Culture-enhanced methodologies, when introduced, should also lead to substantial increases in fish production from these water bodies.},

abstract = {Lake Balkhash is a large (18,000 km3), closed, and slightly saline lake in the south-west of Kazakhstan. It is divided into two basins, a south-western and an eastern basin. These have somewhat different limnological conditions, but the most obvious one is that the south-western basin has a salinity of {\textless}2 g L-1 whereas the salinity of the eastern basin is ∼4 g L-1. Numerous fish and invertebrate introductions, many successful, have been made. In 1969, a dam impounding the Kapchagay reservoir was constructed on the River Ili, the major river flowing into the lake. The impoundment of water in this reservoir caused a fall of some 1.5 m in the water-level of the lake. This fall, together with other events on the catchment, caused considerable damage to reedswamps in the lake, to the fishery and to conservation values. A number of suggestions has been made on how to prevent further damage. Some, particularly those involving a moratorium on further filling of Kapchagay reservoir and irrigation, have been implemented, at least in part. This has caused some remission in environmental damage and provides for cautious optimism with regard to the lake's future. Even so, the environmental status of the lake remains vulnerable and many dangers persist. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the long-term trends and variations of temperature and precipitation on annual timescale in the Ili-Balkhash Basin (IBB), Kazakhstan. Some statistical tools were employed to detect any climate variations at four stations in the IBB during the period between 1936 and 2005. These methods included the Mann-Kendall trend test, the Theil-Sen approach, and the sequential Mann-Kendall test. The results showed that in temporal scale, the climate in the IBB has been becoming warmer and wetter in the past several decades as a whole. The annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation in the IBB showed an increasing trend since the 1970s and the 1940s, respectively. The significance of the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation trends in the IBB was tested at {\textgreater}95 {\%} confidence level. The slope of the increasing trend of annual mean temperature ranges from 0.019 to 0.029 °C/year, and that of the annual precipitation ranges from 0.654 to 2.179 mm/year. In spatial scale, the multiyear mean values of temperature and precipitation are greater in the southern mountain region than those in the northern plain and hilly land area of the basin. The multiyear mean temperature decreases with the increasing latitudes, while increases with the increasing altitudes except for Karaganda; the multiyear mean precipitation increase with the increasing altitudes, while decreases centered with the Lake Balkhash from the surrounding area. The results may provide climatic backgrounds for solving the problems related to water sources of the IBB. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The decrease of river runoff draining into Lake Balkhash in Central Asia was investigated using hydrological and meteorological data over a long-term period. The data from the difference integral curves of the annual runoff from 1911 to 1986 suggested that a low-flow period began in 1970 in the River Ili, and in 1973 in the east rivers, continuing until 1986. Compared with the runoff before 1969, the decrease of runoff in the upper reaches of the River Ili was less than those in the middle and lower reaches. The decrease in the upper reaches resulted from natural variability, whereas those of the middle and lower reaches were due to a combination of the effects of climate and human activity. There are two reasons for this. First, after 1970, precipitation did not decrease uniformly across the entire basin. Second, in 1970, the Kapchagay dam started operating. As a result, the annual inflow into Lake Balkhash from the River Ili after 1970 decreased to 77{\%} of the pre-1969 mean. Similarly, after 1973, the inflow from the east rivers was 75{\%} of the pre-1972 mean. The characteristics of the runoff in the growing season (April to September) and those in the non-growing season (October to March) were investigated for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the River Ili. In all reaches, the runoff in the non-growing season remained unchanged both before and after 1969. However, from 1970 to 1986, decreases of river flow in the growing season were 2{\textperiodcentered}0 to 2{\textperiodcentered}5 times greater in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches. This was primarily due to the impacts of human activity. In conclusion, it can be deduced that the decrease in runoff after 1970 in the middle and lower reaches was the result of human activity during the low-flow period.},

abstract = {Balkhash Lake and its environs are a very fragile ecosystem, whose dynamics exhibits large oscillations in magnitude caused by climatic factors and human impacts. The most recent oscillation was accompanied by construction of a water storage reservoir on the Ili River, the main inflow to the lake, leading to an additional decrease in the Balkhash Lake water level, and to dehydration of wetland landscapes in the Ili River delta. The main purpose of this study was to model the link between wetland biomass conditions in the Ili River delta and changes in the Balkhash Lake water level. A monthly, coarse-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset was used as an indicator of vegetation activity and biomass dynamics in the Ili River delta wetland for the period between 1982 and 2003. The NDVI displays significant intra-annual and interannual variability strongly correlated with Ili River discharge and Balkhash Lake water level. This study also developed a simple model between NDVI and the two hydrological variables used in monitoring the hydrological regime of Balkhash Lake and its catchment basin. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

The Ile Delta, 8000km2 large, is the largest natural delta and wetland complex of Central Asia and therefore is of crucial significance for the biodiversity of that region. In this paper, we reviewed the literature available with regard to vegetation, fauna, and biodiversity of the Ile River Delta and South Lake Balkhash Ramsar Site, in order to identify threats and research gaps. Threats are reduced runoff of the Ile River due to increasing water consumption upstream, overfishing, fires ignited by local people, logging for fuel wood collection, over-grazing, and water pollution from upstream. Major research gaps to be addressed are: 1) impact of reduced discharges of the Ile River on the wetland ecosystems and associated changes in livestock grazing, 2) impact of reduced discharges on spawning grounds for fish, 3) upper harvest limits for the fishery, and 4) regrowth of riparian woodlands.},

In this paper, we analyzed the major drivers affecting shared water vulnerability in China, namely: (1) changes in physical conditions affecting the availability of water; (2) competing objectives between economic development and ecological conservation; (3) lack of emergency response mechanisms; (4) unsound administrative institutions; and (5) shortcomings in the development of regional cooperation based on transboundary waters. We concluded by identifying four pathways for reducing vulnerability: (1) encouraging scientific research cooperation; (2) constructing information-sharing channels; (3) establishing early-warning mechanisms; and (4) promoting further coordination and negotiation.},

abstract = {Crop mapping is one major component of agricultural resource monitoring using remote sensing. Yield or water demand modeling requires that both, the total surface that is cultivated and the accurate distribution of crops, respectively is known. Map quality is crucial and influences the model outputs. Although the use of multi-spectral time series data in crop mapping has been acknowledged, the potentially high dimensionality of the input data remains an issue. In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3{\%}, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection. Uncertainty measures from SVM are an informative source of information on the spatial distribution of error in the crop maps. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.
