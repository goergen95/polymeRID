Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Welcome to my website on polymeRID!</h2>
<p>Here I present the results of my work for a master’s seminar at the University of Marburg concerned with microplastic in the environment.<br />
<br> <img src="assets/images/seperators.jpg" alt="Probe Seperators" /><br> <em>Photo of two sediment separators taken by Sarah Brüning</em></p>
<p>Microplastic particles polluting the envrionment have been in the public focuse for some time now. The scientific efforts of analysing the occurences of particles in the envrionment and their effects on ecosystems and human health is manifold, yet there is a lack of consensus on methods for sampling, sample handling, analysis and identification, especially for samples from aquatic ecosystems. Some of the most urgent research questions concerned with microplastic in the envrionment are the analysis of effects on biological lifeforms <span class="citation">(Zhang et al. <a href="#ref-Zhang2019">2019</a>)</span>, their movement and distribution in the marine environment <span class="citation">(Auta, Emenike, and Fauziah <a href="#ref-Auta2017">2017</a>)</span> as well as in freshwater systems <span class="citation">(Li, Liu, and Paul Chen <a href="#ref-Li2018b">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Different research questions demand for different methodologies for sampling, sample handling and labroratory analysis. However, the link between these knowledge gaps is that any analysis of microplastics in the environment needs a robust identification method to enable scientist to draw the right conclusions and to bring forward recommendations to the public and decision makers to act upon their research findings.</p>
<p>Evidently, there also exist a broad spectrum of different polymer identification strategies <span class="citation">(Löder and Gerdts <a href="#ref-Loder2015">2015</a>; Rocha-Santos and Duarte <a href="#ref-Rocha-Santos2015a">2015</a>; Shim, Hong, and Eo <a href="#ref-Shim2017">2017</a>)</span>, ranging from traditional microscopy to spectroscopy as well as destructive methods of thermal analysis. A destinction has to be made concerning towards the extent of automatisation in identification processes. Lately, different approaches to automate in the identification process, either by individual elements or for whole samples on a focal plane, have reported to the scientifc community <span class="citation">(Masoumi, Safavi, and Khani <a href="#ref-Masoumi2012">2012</a>; Primpke et al. <a href="#ref-Primpke2017">2017</a>; Lorenzo-Navarro et al. <a href="#ref-Lorenzo-Navarro2018">2018</a>; Zhang et al. <a href="#ref-Zhang2018">2018</a>; Primpke, Dias, and Gerdts <a href="#ref-Primpke2019">2019</a>)</span></p>
<p>This project sets out to contribute to the ease of the cumbersome process of classfiying indivdual particles based on their spectral reflectance by hand. The idea is that up-to-date machine learning models applied to the high-dimensional spectral data of particles found in envrionmental samples can minimize the need for human intervention in the classification process and thus significantly speed up the process of categorizing found particles. Other studies have reported substantial accuracies by applying different sorts of machine learning algorithms such as hirarchial clustering <span class="citation">(Primpke et al. <a href="#ref-Primpke2017">2017</a>)</span>, support-vector-machines <span class="citation">(V. Bianco P. Memmolo <a href="#ref-bianco2019">2019</a>)</span>, random forest <span class="citation">(Hufnagl et al. <a href="#ref-Hufnagl2019">2019</a>)</span>, as well as convolutional neural networks <span class="citation">(Liu et al. <a href="#ref-Liu2017">2017</a>)</span> to classify microplastics and other materials spectra.</p>
<p>This project was grouped into different working steps, which also were designed to allow reproducibility as well individual alteration of the code and data base. These working steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preparation</strong>: At first the establishment of a comprehensive database of reference spectra was mandatory to allow the application of machine learning models. The preparation steps included spectral re-sampling and labeling of reference polymers and natural particles. Later, this database underwent some steps of baseline corrections as well as different level of pre-processing such as normalization and Savtizkiy-Golay filtering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploration</strong>: At the different types of pre-processing techniques were assessed by a brute-force method in which all different levels of the data were presented to different machine learning models and their capability to correctly classify the data-set was captured. Additionally, different levels of noise was added to the data so that the models and pre-processing types which most robustly classify the spectra could be identified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calibration</strong>: After the exploration stage, a applicable algorithm which can be calibrated to a potentially changing database needed to be established. That was important, so that the code can be used in the future as well e.g. when the reference database should be extended or the wave-numbers of interest might change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Classification</strong>: This last stage is the core part of the project in the sense that at this stage real environmental samples are to be classified in a user-friendly way to ease the categorization process. That means that some accuracy values of the classification need to be easily accessible as well as some possibilities for a human agent to assess the accuracy</p></li>
